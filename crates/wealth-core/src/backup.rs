//! The backup format, and how one of its rows becomes a row in this file.
//!
//! # What this module is a port of, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! It is the translation half of `restore_user_chunk`
//! (`supabase/migrations/20260807083000_user_data_restore.sql:230-374`) — the
//! part that takes *whole rows* out of a backup and puts them in a table.
//!
//! It is **not** a port of `backupService.remapBackupIds`. That runs on the
//! CLIENT, before a single row is sent, and the RPCs insert what they are handed
//! verbatim (`:279-294` re-owns and strips columns; it never touches an `id`).
//! The boundary matters enough to state twice: **ids arrive already remapped, or
//! they do not arrive remapped at all.** Nothing here invents an id, rewrites a
//! reference or resolves a dangling one, because the function it ports does none
//! of those things — and a Rust copy of the remapper would be a second
//! implementation of a rule the TypeScript already owns, drifting from it the
//! first time a column is added.
//!
//! # The column list is not written twice
//!
//! The cloud hands each row to `jsonb_populate_recordset` against the table's own
//! rowtype rather than naming columns, and the migration explains why at length:
//! *"Naming them was the first draft and it was wrong within the hour"*. SQLite
//! has no such facility, so the names are written down here — once, in one table
//! per entity, with the cloud's key on the left and this schema's column on the
//! right. That table IS the map between the two schemas, and it is the only
//! place either name appears.
//!
//! Every column name in an INSERT built here comes from a `&'static str` in that
//! table. No caller value is ever concatenated into SQL; values travel as bound
//! parameters. DESIGN.md §6.4's *"you cannot bypass what does not exist"* holds
//! through the one verb that takes arbitrary JSON.
//!
//! # Four things the cloud does that this must do differently
//!
//! 1. **Scale.** `numeric(20,2)` becomes `INTEGER` minor units, quantities and
//!    prices become `_e8`, `alert_threshold` becomes basis points. Each is a
//!    [`Kind`] and each is exact: a decimal string is scaled by integer
//!    arithmetic and a value with more places than the column can hold is
//!    REFUSED, never rounded ([`crate::money`] makes the same choice for the same
//!    reason).
//! 2. **Arrays.** `transactions.tags` and `suggestion_dismissals.subject_ids` are
//!    `text[]` and `uuid[]` in the cloud and child tables here. They are written
//!    after their parent row, in the same transaction.
//! 3. **Money in `metadata`.** DESIGN.md §5 divergence 9, *"the one most likely
//!    to bite: it is a hard failure on real data"*. `transactions_no_money_in_metadata`
//!    refuses eleven keys that a cloud backup legitimately carries. Four have a
//!    typed home and are PROMOTED into it; the other eight are dropped and every
//!    drop is REPORTED. See [`strip_metadata_money`].
//! 4. **Absent keys, and the null that is not one.** The cloud USED to refuse a
//!    row missing any NOT NULL key, because `jsonb_populate_recordset` supplies
//!    an explicit SQL NULL rather than the column's default — MEASURED: a row
//!    with no `low_balance_alert_enabled` was refused even though the column has
//!    a default. That was a live data-safety defect (every file exported before
//!    2026-08-10 failed to restore) and `20260811090000` fixed it by reading the
//!    schema's own constant defaults and laying them under each row. Here an
//!    absent key simply omits the column, so the engine applies the default and
//!    the fix needs no mechanism. What the same migration ALSO settled is the
//!    rule this file now keeps in both directions: **omitted is not the same as
//!    null**. A key stated as null on a NULLABLE column is a deliberate null and
//!    is stored as one; on a NOT NULL column it is treated as absent, because no
//!    legal export could have produced it. See [`insert_row`], which reads the
//!    nullability from the schema rather than from a list.
//!
//! 5. **Getting a row back OUT.** [`read_rows`] is the collect side, and it goes
//!    through the SAME column tables in reverse. One map, two directions: a file
//!    written here is a file the cloud's restore reads, and a file written there
//!    is one this restore reads, because neither side has a column list of its
//!    own to drift with.
//!
//! # Unknown keys are ignored, because they are ignored in the cloud
//!
//! MEASURED: `jsonb_populate_recordset` silently discards a key that is not a
//! column. A row carrying `a_column_that_does_not_exist` inserts fine. So does
//! one here. That is not a preference — a stricter local reading would refuse
//! files the cloud accepts, including every backup taken before a column was
//! dropped.
//!
//! All examples in this file are invented.

        // In the cloud that falls out of two mechanisms: `jsonb_populate_recordset`
        // emits an EXPLICIT NULL for every column the JSON does not mention, and
        // 20260811090000 then lays the schema's constant defaults under the row
        // for exactly one class — *"NOT NULL WITH a default, which is the only
        // class this fills in"*. Here the same two outcomes are reached by
        // choosing between binding NULL and leaving the column out of the
        // INSERT, which is what makes SQLite apply its default.
        //
        // MEASURED, and the measurement is why this reads as it does: the first
        // draft filled a silence from the default wherever there was one, and
        // the differential spec caught it on `transactions.is_reconciled` — a
        // file from before that column existed came back `0` here and NULL in
        // the cloud. NULL there MEANS *"this row predates the split between
        // marking and committing; ask is_cleared"*, and `0` means *"explicitly
        // not committed"*. Filling it in would offer a decade of reconciled
        // statements back to somebody to do again.
        //
        // A stated null on a NOT NULL column is treated as a silence for the
        // reason the migration gives: no legal export could have produced it,
        // because the column refuses NULL, so it is a hand-edited file or a

//
// The other direction, and the reason this module is where it lives rather than
// two modules that happen to agree. Everything above translates a backup row
// into a stored row; everything below translates a stored row into a backup row,
// THROUGH THE SAME COLUMN TABLE. The tables are the map between two schemas, and
// a second copy of that map — a collector with a column list of its own — is a
// file that exports what it cannot import. That is not a hypothetical shape: it
// is what a hand-written collector produces the first time somebody adds a
// column to one list and not the other, and the failure surfaces only when a
// person restores.
//
// It is also the whole of B-11's claim, made structural: ONE format, read by
// both editions. A cloud file restores here because [`insert_row`] reads the
// cloud's keys; a file written here restores THERE because [`read_rows`] writes
// the cloud's keys. The keys are the same `&'static str` in both cases, so the
// two statements cannot drift apart.

/// The exact inverse of [`scale`]: a scaled integer as its decimal text.
///
/// Money crosses this seam as the number's own decimal spelling (PHASE3-PLAN
/// D-4), never as a JSON number — a JSON number is an IEEE-754 double by the
/// time any parser has read it, and `backupService.MAX_EXACT_MONEY` exists
/// because that trip is only exact below 2^53 hundredths. A decimal string has
/// no such ceiling and both engines' restores accept one: [`scale`] reads it
/// here, and `jsonb_populate_recordset` casts it to `numeric` there.
///
/// `hundredths_to_decimal_string` is the two-place case and this is the same
/// algorithm generalised, for [`scale`]'s reason: quantities and prices are not
/// money and must not acquire money's type on the way past.
// Every operation is bounded by construction: `places` comes from a `Kind` in
// the column table above and is never more than 10, so the divisor is at most
// 10^10 and cannot overflow a u64; the divisor is never zero, so neither the
// division nor the remainder can trap. Spelled out rather than switching the
