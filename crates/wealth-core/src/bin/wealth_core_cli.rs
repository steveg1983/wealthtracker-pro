//! The differential harness's bridge into the command layer.
//!
//! ```text
//! wealth-core-cli --db <path>        JSON command on stdin, JSON result on stdout
//! wealth-core-cli --apply-schema --db <path>   create the file and apply the schema
//! wealth-core-cli --version                    engine and crate versions, as JSON
//! ```
//!
//! # What is here, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! Arguments, stdin, stdout, exit codes. That is the whole of it.
//!
//! The verb set, the dispatch over it and the envelope an answer travels in are
//! [`wealth_core::command`], in the library, because the desktop shell's one
//! `#[tauri::command]` runs the same match and a second copy of it would be a
//! second verb set (PHASE3-PLAN D-3). This file is one caller of that module; it
//! does not own the surface, and nothing about the wire is decided here.
//!
//! # Why a spawned binary and not a native Node addon
//!
//! `scripts/local-sqlite/lib/sqlite.mjs` states the constraint this repo already
//! decided: *"this repo ships a browser bundle and a Vercel function set —
//! adding a native, node-gyp-compiled devDependency for a schema harness buys a
//! prebuild/rebuild failure mode on every `npm ci`"*. A napi-rs binding would be
//! exactly that devDependency. A spawned binary has **zero** npm surface: the
//! harness runs it if it is built and says so plainly if it is not, and
//! `npm ci` never learns Rust exists.
//!
//! The Node runner already drives `psql` this way — one process per spec, JSON
//! or text out — so the two engines are driven by the same shape and neither
//! gets a structural advantage in the comparison.
//!
//! The cost is a process spawn per command. MEASURED, 40 runs after 3 warm-ups
//! on an M-series laptop: median **2.50 ms**, min 2.20, p95 3.42; the whole
//! 16-spec suite including the Postgres side is 0.66 s wall clock. A long-lived
//! JSON-lines daemon would save single-digit milliseconds in exchange for a
//! failure mode — a hung child holding a write lock on the temp database — that
//! is much worse than the latency it saves. It is also why the APP does not
//! arrive this way: a spawn per call is fine for a spec and wrong for a rename
//! of three thousand rows, which is the measurement behind D-3's in-process
//! command for the shell.
//!
//! # Why the Node side owns the file and the Rust side only writes to it
//!
//! The harness creates the temp database, applies `schema.sql` and the fixture
//! with `node:sqlite`, then calls this binary, then re-opens the file to run its
//! assertions. So the verb is exercised against the **vendored** schema, applied
//! by the same code path that applies it for the existing 54 constraint specs —
//! not against a copy this crate keeps. `--apply-schema` exists only for the
//! crate's own integration tests, which have no Node runner to do it for them.
