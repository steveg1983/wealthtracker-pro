//! `update_budget` — the port of a PostgREST `UPDATE`, of the `.single()` on the
//! end of it, and of one line in the mapper that renames a budget nobody asked
//! to rename.
//!
//! # What it is a port OF
//!
//! `planningService.updateBudget` (`:273-287`):
//!
//! ```text
//! .from('budgets').update(budgetToDb(updates))
//!   .eq('id', id).eq('user_id', userId).select().single()
//! ```
//!
//! No RPC, for the reason [`super::create_budget`] gives: `budgets` is one of the
//! tables the cloud writes directly. PHASE3-PLAN D-2.
//!
//! # ONE presence rule, and it is `budgetToDb`'s
//!
//! Twelve `if (b.k !== undefined)` lines. `undefined` means *leave this alone*
//! and is dropped; anything else — `null` included — is sent. So every field
//! below is the `p ? 'k'` class [`super::update_account`] describes: **the key
//! being present is the whole test, and a JSON null stores NULL.** Where the
//! column is `NOT NULL` (`amount`, `period`, `start_date`, `rollover`,
//! `alert_threshold`, `is_active`, and `name` — see below) a stated null is
//! refused by the file, on both engines.
//!
//! # THE ONE LINE THAT IS NOT AN ASSIGNMENT: A CATEGORY CHANGE RENAMES THE BUDGET
//!
//! ```text
//! if (b.name !== undefined || b.categoryId !== undefined) {
//!   row.name = b.name ?? b.categoryId ?? 'Budget';
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Two keys decide ONE column, and the surprising half is the second: an update
//! that moves a budget to a different category, and says nothing about its name,
//! **rewrites the name to the category id**. That is not a rule anybody would
//! choose — it is what falls out of a mapper that fills in a `NOT NULL` column —
//! and it is reproduced here rather than tidied, because the tidy version leaves
//! the two engines disagreeing about what a budget is called after an ordinary
//! edit, which is the exact class of difference this port exists to prevent.
//!
//! Note `??` and not `||`: a stated empty name is an empty name, and only
//! `undefined`/`null` fall through to the category. A stated null CATEGORY falls
//! through again, to the literal `'Budget'`.
//!
//! It lives in the verb rather than in `mappers/writes.ts` for the reason
//! [`super::create_budget`]'s two defaults do: the harness sends ONE payload to
//! both engines, so a derivation applied on the TypeScript side arrives
//! already-applied and can never be compared. The oracle transcribes the same
//! three-way choice.
//!
//! # `spent` IS SETTABLE HERE AND NOT ON A CREATE, AND THAT IS THE CLOUD
//!
//! `budgetToDb` has a `spent` line and `createBudget` overrides it to zero;
//! neither is this verb's decision. The seam's *"`spent` is summed from the
//! ledger, never stored knowledge"* is a statement about where the FIGURE comes
//! from, and the column is written by whatever recomputes it. A verb that
//! refused the key would refuse a write the cloud performs.
//!
//! # A BUDGET THAT IS NOT THERE IS REFUSED, AND ONE THAT IS GONE IS NOT
//!
//! `.single()` is the whole difference between this verb and
//! [`super::delete_budget`], which accepts an id naming nothing. PostgREST raises
//! `PGRST116` when an update matches no row and `.single()` is on the query; the
//! delete has no `.single()` and no rows matched is a successful call with
//! nothing done.
//!
//! The seam states the same rule from the app's end: *"A budget that is not there
//! is refused BY NAME rather than created, and the refusal leaves the store
//! exactly as it was."* The refusal is `budget_not_found`, and
//! [`super::create_budget`] carries the argument about where its WORDS come from
//! — this is the first family in the crate whose refusal the cloud has no
//! sentence for.
//!
//! # It audits
//!
//! One `budget/update` entry, `before` and `after`, in the same transaction. See
//! [`super::create_budget`] for the family's argument and for PHASE1-PLAN §2.2,
//! which decided it before any of these verbs existed.
//!
//! # No guard, measured
//!
//! An UPDATE of `budgets`. `schema.sql` has no trigger on that table; the cloud
//! has one (`update_budgets_updated_at`), which is why this verb writes
//! `updated_at` itself rather than leaving it to a trigger that does not exist
//! here. `tests/planning_writes.rs` asserts the guard table empty across an edit.
