//! `create_budget` — a limit somebody set, and the two columns the writer fills
//! in so the table will take it.
//!
//! # What it is a port OF
//!
//! `planningService.createBudget` (`:256-271`), whose whole body is four lines:
//!
//! ```text
//! const row = budgetToDb({ ...budget, spent: 0 }, userId);
//! if (!row.start_date) row.start_date = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10);
//! if (!row.name)       row.name       = budget.categoryId || 'Budget';
//! .from('budgets').insert(row).select().single()
//! ```
//!
//! No RPC. `budgets` is one of the tables the cloud writes DIRECTLY over
//! PostgREST — PHASE3-PLAN D-2, argued in full at the head of [`super`] — so
//! what is ported is the WRITE ITSELF: `budgetToDb`'s column list, the two
//! defaults above it, and the `.select().single()` that hands the stored row
//! back.
//!
//! # `spent` IS THE WRITER'S ZERO, NOT THE CALLER'S
//!
//! `{ ...budget, spent: 0 }` is the cloud writer overriding whatever it was
//! handed, and the seam says why in the same words: *"`spent` is not supplied
//! because it is not stored knowledge — it is the sum of the rows filed under
//! that category in the period, recomputed from the ledger"*. The column exists
//! because the cloud has one; it starts at zero on both engines because both
//! writers say so, and this verb has no `spent` argument at all rather than one
//! it would then ignore. An UPDATE may still set it (`budgetToDb` has the line),
//! which is [`super::update_budget`]'s business and is faithful to the cloud.
//!
//! # THE TWO DEFAULTS ARE A `NOT NULL` COLUMN BEING SATISFIED
//!
//! `start_date` and `name` are `NOT NULL` with no default in BOTH engines, and
//! `budgetToDb` can produce a row with neither — so the writer fills them in
//! after the mapper and before the insert. Both are reproduced here, in the verb
//! rather than in `mappers/writes.ts`, for one reason: the harness sends ONE
//! payload to both engines, and a default applied on the TypeScript side would
//! arrive already-applied and could never be compared. The oracle transcribes
//! the same two lines.
//!
//! `start_date`'s value is *today*, and WHICH today is divergence D-8: this
//! engine takes the UTC day, off the file's own clock, inside the write's
//! transaction. `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)` is the UTC day too, so
//! the two agree by construction rather than by luck.
//!
//! `name`'s is `budget.categoryId || 'Budget'`, and it is the SECOND time that
//! expression runs: `budgetToDb` already wrote `b.name ?? b.categoryId ??
//! 'Budget'`. The two differ, and the difference is reachable — `??` passes an
//! empty string through and `||` does not — so a budget created with `name: ''`
//! is stored as its category id in both engines. Reproduced rather than tidied,
//! because the tidy version stores a budget with no name on the budgets page.
//!
//! # THE THRESHOLD IS NOT MONEY AND IS NOT A FLOAT EITHER
//!
//! `alert_threshold` is `numeric(5,2)` in the cloud (80.00 meaning 80%) and
//! `alert_threshold_bp` here — an INTEGER count of hundredths of a percent, 8000
//! meaning the same thing — because `schema.sql` keeps every fractional quantity
//! out of floating point. It therefore crosses the wire in the same spelling
//! money does, a plain decimal string, and is parsed by
//! [`crate::money::hundredths_from_decimal_string`], which is
//! [`crate::money::Money::parse`]'s grammar WITHOUT its type: a percentage that
//! was a [`Money`] would be eligible for every arithmetic this crate reserves
//! for amounts.
//!
//! Out of range is the FILE's refusal (`alert_threshold_bp BETWEEN 0 AND
//! 10000`), which the cloud's `numeric(5,2)` mirrors from the other direction by
//! refusing anything that will not fit in five digits.
//!
//! # IT AUDITS, AND THE CLOUD HAS NOTHING TO AUDIT FROM — DIVERGENCE 10
//!
//! One `budget/create` entry, chained, in the same transaction. The cloud writes
//! none: `write_financial_audit` is called from inside atomic RPCs and there is
//! no atomic RPC here, so in the cloud creating a budget, changing its amount or
//! deleting it leaves no trace at all.
//!
//! **This is a decision that was taken before this verb existed**, and it is
//! worth reading rather than re-deriving. PHASE1-PLAN §2.2 traced U-1 (*"every
//! financial write emits an audit row"*) against `planningService`, found it
//! true of accounts, transactions and splits and FALSE of `budgets.amount`,
//! `budgets.spent`, `goals.target_amount` and `goals.current_amount`, and ruled:
//! *"the local edition fixes it. Budgets and goals are audited."* Its reasons,
//! in its own order:
//!
//! 1. the reason U-1 exists is the compliance answer to *"what changed that
//!    figure"*, and a budget amount and a goal target are figures a user will
//!    ask that about;
//! 2. the cost of fixing it is one call inside a verb that has to exist anyway,
//!    and `financial_audit_log` already accepts an arbitrary `entity` — the
//!    cloud's CHECK is on `action` alone, so no schema changes on either side;
//! 3. the cost of REPLICATING the gap is that the local edition ships a known
//!    compliance hole on purpose, and every future reader has to be told it was
//!    deliberate.
//!
//! The cloud's own newer code agrees, from the other end: `merge_categories`
//! audits a budget whose category it moved, and says why in words this verb
//! inherits — *"budgets have no other audited write path today, and this one is
//! not going to be the first silent change to what a budget measures"*
//! (`20260805214322:291-294`). Slice 22 is the commit where that sentence stops
//! being true, and it stops being true the right way round.
//!
//! It is DECLARED in DESIGN.md §5 as divergence 10 and asserted by name in the
//! differential suite — once per entity, in a spec that exists for it, rather
//! than on every spec in the family. [`super::delete_unused_categories`] argues
//! that restraint: *"a family of divergences is how a real one gets missed"*.
//!
//! # No guard, measured
//!
//! An INSERT into `budgets`. `schema.sql` has no trigger on that table at all,
//! and no foreign key of it points anywhere a trigger watches. The cloud DOES
//! have one — `update_budgets_updated_at`, `BEFORE UPDATE` — which is why every
//! verb in this family writes `updated_at` itself rather than leaving it to a
//! trigger that has no local twin. `tests/planning_writes.rs` asserts the guard
//! table empty across a create rather than reasoning about it.
