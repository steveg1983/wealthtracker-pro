# Vite Server Startup Issue

## Problem
Vite reports that it's running but doesn't actually bind to any port. This appears to be a system-specific issue where the Node.js HTTP server module isn't functioning correctly with Vite.

## Temporary Solution
Use the preview build instead of dev server:

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Serve the built app
npm run preview
```

## Root Cause Investigation
1. Basic Node.js HTTP servers work (tested with custom script)
2. Vite's dev server reports success but doesn't bind to ports
3. This suggests an issue with how Vite initializes its server on your system

## Permanent Fix Options
1. **Reinstall Node.js**: The issue might be with your Node.js installation
   ```bash
   brew reinstall node
   ```

2. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm -rf ~/.npm
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   ```

3. **Use a different Node version**:
   ```bash
   nvm install 20
   nvm use 20
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check for conflicting software**: 
   - VPN software
   - Firewall/Security software
   - Network monitoring tools

## Alternative Development Setup
If the issue persists, you can use a simple Express server for development:

```bash
node express-dev-server.js
```
