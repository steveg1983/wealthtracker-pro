# UX Testing Strategy for WealthTracker

## How You Can Best Help Me Improve UX

### 1. Screenshots with Context
**Most Effective Format:**
- Take screenshot of the issue
- Include a brief description like:
  - "Expected: Should be able to edit transaction inline"
  - "Actual: Have to open modal every time"
  - "Friction: Takes 3 clicks instead of 1"

### 2. User Journey Recording
**Using Playwright Test Recorder:**
```bash
# Record your interactions
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:5174

# This opens a browser where you can:
# 1. Perform the actions that are frustrating
# 2. It generates test code showing exact steps
# 3. Share that code with me
```

### 3. Critical User Workflows to Test

#### Financial Workflows
1. **Add Transaction Flow**
   - How many clicks to add a transaction?
   - Is the form intuitive?
   - Does it remember previous categories?

2. **Reconciliation Flow**
   - Can you easily match transactions?
   - Is the balance clear?
   - Are cleared transactions obvious?

3. **Budget Check Flow**
   - How quickly can you see if you're on budget?
   - Are overages immediately visible?
   - Can you drill down easily?

4. **Investment Tracking**
   - Can you update prices easily?
   - Is performance calculation clear?
   - Are gains/losses obvious?

#### Daily Use Cases
- Morning: Check account balances
- Shopping: Add expense on mobile
- Evening: Review daily spending
- Weekend: Reconcile accounts
- Month-end: Review budget performance

## Playwright Test Examples

### Example 1: Testing Transaction Addition
```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('should add transaction with minimal friction', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5174');
  
  // Test: How many clicks to add a transaction?
  const clicksRequired = 0;
  
  // Find FAB or Add button
  await page.click('[data-testid="fab-button"]');
  clicksRequired++;
  
  // Fill form
  await page.fill('[name="description"]', 'Coffee');
  await page.fill('[name="amount"]', '4.50');
  await page.selectOption('[name="category"]', 'Dining');
  
  // Submit
  await page.click('[type="submit"]');
  clicksRequired++;
  
  // Should be 2 clicks max for common transaction
  expect(clicksRequired).toBeLessThanOrEqual(2);
});
```

### Example 2: Testing Mobile Responsiveness
```javascript
test('mobile transaction list should be swipeable', async ({ page }) => {
  // Set mobile viewport
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5174/transactions');
  
  // Find transaction row
  const transaction = page.locator('.transaction-row').first();
  
  // Attempt swipe gesture
  await transaction.dragTo(transaction, {
    sourcePosition: { x: 300, y: 50 },
    targetPosition: { x: 100, y: 50 }
  });
  
  // Should reveal action buttons
  await expect(page.locator('.swipe-actions')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## UX Metrics to Track

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Click Depth**: How many clicks to complete common tasks?
- **Time to Task**: How long to add transaction, check balance, etc?
- **Error Rate**: How often do users make mistakes?

### Satisfaction Metrics
- **Delight Moments**: What makes you smile?
- **Friction Points**: What makes you frustrated?
- **Missing Features**: What do you wish it could do?

## How to Report UX Issues

### High-Impact Format
```markdown
**Task**: Adding a transfer between accounts
**Current**: 5 clicks, 2 modals, confusing flow
**Expected**: 2 clicks, inline form, obvious flow
**Impact**: Do this 10x per month = 30 wasted clicks
**Screenshot**: [attached]
```

### Quick Format
```markdown
ISSUE: Can't see running balance in transaction list
NEED: Running balance column
WHY: Helps spot errors quickly
```

## Automated UX Testing We Can Set Up

1. **User Flow Tests**
   - Record your actual workflow
   - Convert to Playwright tests
   - Run automatically on changes

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure time to interactive
   - Track response times
   - Monitor bundle size impact

3. **Accessibility Tests**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast validation

## Next Steps

1. **You provide**:
   - Screenshots of friction points
   - Description of ideal workflow
   - Playwright recordings if possible

2. **I will**:
   - Create automated tests for those workflows
   - Fix the friction points
   - Ensure changes don't break other flows

## Questions to Consider

As you use the app, ask yourself:
1. "Why does this take so many clicks?"
2. "Why can't I do this inline?"
3. "Why do I have to leave this page?"
4. "Why isn't this information visible immediately?"
5. "Why doesn't it remember my preference?"

These questions help identify UX improvements that truly matter.
