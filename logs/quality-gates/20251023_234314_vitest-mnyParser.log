Command: npm run test -- --run src/utils/__tests__/mnyParser.test.ts
Result: 29 tests (29 passed / 0 failed)
Notes:
- Replaced console spies with logger-based assertions and ensured debug/info logging emits expected payloads.
- Tightened currency validation in applyMappingToData to skip records lacking numeric content instead of coercing to zero.
- Validated MBF/MNY diagnostic logging remains observable while respecting test-mode logger guards.
