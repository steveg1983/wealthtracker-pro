Command: npm run test -- --run src/hooks/__tests__/useBulkOperations.real.test.ts
Result: 1 test (1 passed / 0 failed)
Notes:
- Updated the suite to call `useBulkOperations` with explicit items and operations, mirroring the live hook contract.
- Validated selection toggles, async operation execution, and automatic selection reset with logger-safe error handling in place.
