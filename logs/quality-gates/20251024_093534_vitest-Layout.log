Vitest Focused Run: Layout component
UTC Timestamp: 2025-10-24 09:35:34
Command: npm run test -- --run src/components/__tests__/Layout.test.tsx
Result: 2 tests (2 passed / 0 failed)
Notes:
- Added local render/test utilities to decouple from the shared testing package dependencies.
- Mocked Clerk, realtime alerts, offline/indexedDB services to avoid hitting network/IDB when running headless tests.
