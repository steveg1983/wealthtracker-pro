Commands:
- rg "\\bas\\s+any\\b" apps/web/src
- npm run test -- --run src/services/api/__tests__/userIdService.test.ts
Highlights:
- Introduced typed Supabase client mock and fixtures via @wealthtracker/testing to eliminate ad-hoc stubs.
- Updated userIdService wiring to accept typed SupabaseClientLike overrides without `unknown` casts.
- Reworked api/userIdService.test.ts to consume the shared mock and fixtures, keeping logger expectations intact.
Metrics:
- `as any` count: 0 (unchanged)
- userIdService Vitest suite: 7 passed / 0 failed
