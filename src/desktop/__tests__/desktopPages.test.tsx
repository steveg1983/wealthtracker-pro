/**
 * THE WINDOW, RENDERED — with a ledger behind it, and the app's own pages in it.
 *
 * Every other check in this edition is about ABSENCE. `desktopEntry.cloudFree`
 * walks the graph and finds no cloud; `desktop:greps` reads the built renderer
 * and finds no cloud; `editionAliases` proves the halves are substitutable;
 * `desktopRouter` proves every web address has a desktop answer. All four would
 * pass with equal enthusiasm on a window that renders a blank page, and until
 * the mount's second half that was very nearly what a window did.
 *
 * This is the one that asserts PRESENCE. It opens a ledger, mounts
 * `MountedLedger`, and reads the money off the screen.
 *
 * ── HOW REAL IT IS, EXACTLY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Real: `DesktopApp`, `bootDeviceLedger`, `openDeviceDocument`, `LocalDataPort`,
 * the crate's wire protocol, `deviceIdentity`, the preferences service over the
 * ledger's own transport, `AppContextSupabase` (the actual one — see
 * `setup.desktop.ts`), all seven seams resolved at their DEVICE halves by
 * `vitest.desktop.config.ts`, `components/Layout`, the router, and the pages.
 *
 * Not real: the crate. The ledger below is a fixture that answers the wire
 * protocol rather than a `.db` file, because the alternative needs a Rust
 * toolchain and this needs to run in the same two seconds as the renderer build.
 * What the crate does with a file is the subject of 468 Rust tests, a 127-case
 * contract suite and two nightly differential lanes; none of them can tell you
 * whether the dashboard renders.
 *
 * ── WHY jsdom AND NOT THE APP SUITE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `vitest.config.ts` maps every seam at its CLOUD half and replaces
 * `AppContextSupabase` with a fixture provider for every test in the run. A
 * version of this file living there would render the shared pages over
 * `DataService`, prove nothing about a window, and pass on the day the desktop
 * build broke. `vitest.desktop.config.ts` exists for that one reason.
