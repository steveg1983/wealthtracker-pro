/**
 * `@service`, on a device: seven absences, and one thing that survives somewhere
 * else.
 *
 * The device half of `editions/service.ts`, and the twin of
 * `editions/cloud/service.ts`. All seven answer with nothing, and all seven are
 * ABSENT BY DECISION rather than owed — each belongs to one of the three regions
 * `src/desktop/routes.ts` rules out for the whole edition.
 *
 * ── DangerZone, TRACED, BECAUSE THE OBVIOUS READING IS WRONG ────────────────
 *
 * "A danger zone is where you delete things, a device can delete things, so a
 * device keeps a danger zone" is the reasonable guess and it does not survive
 * reading the component. `components/settings/DangerZone.tsx` is one button and
 * it does one thing: `POST /api/account/delete`, which cancels the Stripe
 * subscription, erases the account's rows through the `users` cascade, removes
 * the CLERK identity, and then signs the browser out. Every noun in that
 * sentence is a thing a device edition does not have. There is nothing to keep.
 *
 * **The wipe is not in it, and never was.** `dataPort.wipeAllFinancialData` — the
 * verb a person means when they say "delete everything in this ledger" — is
 * called from `pages/settings/DataManagement.tsx`, which is `/settings/data`.
 * That page is not mounted in this window YET, and for a reason of its own that
 * has nothing to do with this seam (`routes.ts` names it: the restore dialog is
 * bound to the BROWSER's backup store). When it lands, the wipe lands with it,
 * at the address it has always been at, with its typed confirmation and its
 * progress reporting intact — because the verb behind it is the port's, and
 * `LocalDataPort` answers it against the file.
 *
 * That is worth having written down, because the mistake in the other direction
 * would have been quiet and bad: a desktop DangerZone rebuilt around the wipe
 * would have given this edition TWO delete-everything buttons on two settings
 * pages, one of them a copy, and the copy would have shipped first.
 *
 * ── THE OTHER SIX ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   SubscriptionStatus            plan, renewal date and a link to Stripe's
 *                                 portal. `NEVER_ON_A_DESKTOP` rules on the
 *                                 whole subscription region: whatever this
 *                                 edition is sold as, it is not sold from inside
 *                                 this router.
 *   BankFeedRefreshSettings       how often a SERVER re-polls the institution.
 *                                 There is no server, so there is no schedule —
 *                                 the same reason `@chrome`'s `BackgroundWork`
 *                                 draws nothing.
 *   BankingCriticalIncidentBadge  "the bank feed is having an incident". There
 *                                 is no feed and no service to have one.
 *   BankConnections               the modal that lists a person's bank logins.
 *                                 A consent held by a server, a token refreshed
 *                                 by a cron, and an institution polled on a
 *                                 schedule: the banking region entire. Nothing
 *                                 opens it here — both call sites are behind a
 *                                 button this edition does not draw — and it
 *                                 answers `null` rather than throwing for the
 *                                 same reason the two sync promises resolve.
 *   useBankConnectionSnapshot     the connections already in memory. It never
 *                                 fetched anything even in a browser, but the
 *                                 SERVICE behind it does, and it was reached by
 *                                 the Dashboard and the register — so it is the
 *                                 member the bundle grep found rather than the
 *                                 import walk (`adminClerkId`, a banking-ops
 *                                 query parameter, is a string in that service's
 *                                 URL builder, and no walk of ours calls a string
 *                                 a leak).
 *   useAccountBankSync            per-account feed state and the act of pulling
 *                                 it. The inert result below is what makes the
 *                                 Accounts page's own guards do the work: every
 *                                 account's link is `undefined`, so no feed row
 *                                 draws, and `connectedCount` is 0, so the
 *                                 "Refresh feeds" button is not rendered. NOT
 *                                 ONE LINE of that page changed.
 *
 * ── WHY NOTHING, RATHER THAN AN EXPLANATION ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A panel saying "subscriptions are not available in the local edition" would be
 * telling a person about a product they did not buy, on a settings page they
 * opened to change something else. The edition's own terms belong in its About
 * screen and its licence — which is the ruling `NEVER_ON_A_DESKTOP` already made
 * about `/privacy` and `/terms`, applied one level down.
 *
 * ── WHY THE HOOK'S PROMISES REJECT NOTHING AND DO NOTHING ───────────────────
 *
 * `syncAccount` and `syncAllConnections` resolve rather than throwing "not
 * supported". Nothing can call them: both are behind UI that only exists when
 * there is a connection, and there is never a connection. A throw would be a
 * refusal nobody can provoke, and the first person to provoke it would be a test
 * asserting a message no user can see.
