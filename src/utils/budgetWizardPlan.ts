/**
 * A BUDGET IS A PROPERTY OF ITS CATEGORY — the arithmetic behind the wizard
 * that sets them, kept pure so the screen above it only has to render.
 *
 * The owner's ruling (31 Aug 2026, signed off verbatim): a budget is not a
 * separate object that happens to share a category's name. It is one of that
 * category's properties, stored where it always was — the `budgets` table,
 * keyed by `category_id` — and shown through two lenses:
 *
 *   Manage → Categories   "WHAT IS SET".  Every category row carries its
 *                         budget, as stored, in its own column.
 *   Budget page           "HOW IS IT GOING". Untouched, reading the same rows.
 *
 * The wizard is the third door and the only one that WRITES in bulk, so every
 * rule about what a write means lives here, in one tested place, rather than
 * being re-derived by a component that also has to lay out a grid.
 *
 * ── THE WINDOW: TWELVE COMPLETE MONTHS ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The history is the last twelve COMPLETE calendar months. The current,
 * part-finished month is excluded — a budget set against a month that has not
 * happened yet is set against a category that reads low by however much of the
 * month is left, and every figure on the screen would be quietly short.
 *
 * The window is NAMED on screen ("Sep 2025 – Aug 2026") rather than described
 * ("the last year"), because those are different claims and only one of them
 * can be checked by the person reading it. The label is built with the app's
 * own locale seam (`getDateLocale`, en-GB by default) and the en-dash-with-
 * spaces separator the import screens already use for a month range, so the
 * same range never appears in two spellings.
 *
 * ── WHAT COUNTS AS SPENDING, AND WHAT IS NOT EVEN A ROW ────────────────────
 * Neither question is answered here from scratch. Both defer to the classifier
 * the reports use (`utils/incomeExpense`), reached two ways:
 *
 *   The HISTORY comes from `summariseCategorySpend`, which classifies every
 *   row with `classifyFlow` — so transfers between your own accounts are out
 *   (moving money is not spending it), income is out, and revaluations are out
 *   (a fund falling in value is not an expenditure). Splits are expanded, so a
 *   shop split between two categories lands in both.
 *
 *   The ROWS come from `categoryKindOf`, the same module's per-category half.
 *   A category is budgetable only if its own kind is 'expense'. That one test
 *   excludes income categories (out of scope for v1), the account transfer
 *   categories, the revaluation category and the importer's unassigned bucket
 *   — without this module holding its own list of special ids that could drift
 *   out of step with the reports'.
 *
 * ── EMPTY IS NOT ZERO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The distinction the whole write depends on:
 *
 *   ''   (empty box)  UNBUDGETED. No budget row. If one existed, it is REMOVED
 *                     — clearing a figure is how you take a budget off, and
 *                     step 3 says so by name before anything happens.
 *   '0'  (typed zero) A REAL BUDGET, of nothing. "I intend to spend nothing
 *                     here" is a target somebody can be over. It is written.
 *
 * A box nobody has touched is a third state again: `undefined` rather than ''.
 * It means "as it was" — an existing budget survives untouched, a category
 * without one stays without one. Only a box somebody actually emptied removes.
 *
 * ── A WRITE HAPPENS ONLY WHERE THE MONEY CHANGED ───────────────────────────
 * Comparison is on the MONTHLY EQUIVALENT, never on the typed figure. Somebody
 * who has £1,200/yr stored, opens the wizard in monthly mode and leaves the
 * pre-filled £100 alone has changed nothing — and rewriting that row as
 * £100/mo would churn a stored period for no gain, breaking nothing visibly
 * but making a "12 budgets updated" report out of a session that updated none.
 *
 * ── PERIODS THE WIZARD CANNOT EXPRESS ARE LEFT ALONE ───────────────────────
 * `budgets.period` also allows 'weekly', 'quarterly' and 'custom'. The wizard
 * asks one question — months or years — so it has no honest way to re-express
 * a weekly allowance, and dividing one into a month is a guess (four weeks?
 * 4.348?). Such a row is shown with its stored figure, read-only, pointing at
 * the Budget page, and is in NEITHER list: never rewritten, never removed.
 * Refusing loudly beats converting quietly.
 *
 * ── A CHANGE OF RHYTHM CONVERTS WHAT WAS TYPED ─────────────────────────────
 * The owner, 2 Sep 2026, asked whether switching months for years should carry
 * the figures over: "Yes, it should convert." So typing £90 a month, going
 * back and choosing annually leaves £1,080 in the box — the same money said
 * the other way — rather than £90, which would turn a considered monthly
 * decision into a twelfth of itself without a word.
 *
 * HOW, and the choice is the whole of it: an entry holds THE STRING AS TYPED
 * together with the rhythm it was typed in, and every read converts from that
 * original (`entryInMode`). The alternative — converting the stored string in
 * place at each switch — cannot round-trip, and the counter-example is small
 * enough to be certain about: £100 a year is £8.33 a month, and £8.33 a month
 * is £99.96 a year. Two presses of Back would cost fourpence and twenty would
 * cost real money. Converting from the ORIGINAL each time makes a switch a
 * LENS RATHER THAN AN EDIT: 100 → 8.33 → 100, exactly, however often it is
 * turned over, because nothing anybody typed was ever overwritten.
 *
 * It also keeps the box typeable. A value canonicalised on every keystroke
 * would re-spell "12." as "12" while somebody was still on their way to 12.50.
 *
 * What is NOT converted: an empty box (emptied is emptied, in either rhythm)
 * and a figure that will not read as money — that one is shown exactly as
 * typed and reported by name in step 3, because converting a guess is guessing
 * twice.
 *
 * ── MONEY IS DECIMAL FROM END TO END ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Every figure in and out of this module is a Decimal. The typed string is
 * parsed by `parseMoneyInput` (the app's money parser: pennies, ROUND_HALF_UP,
 * and null for anything that is not a plain number) and is a Decimal from that
 * point on. The twin — ×12 or ÷12 — is Decimal arithmetic quantised to two
 * places, so £1,000/yr reads £83.33/mo rather than 83.33333333333333. A
 * converted entry is rounded by exactly that twin, so the box shows a sum
 * somebody can hold and every figure derived from it — the row's twin, the
 * group total, the scoreboard, the write — reads the box's own string rather
 * than a fuller one kept out of sight. The screen cannot show 8.33 and write
 * 8.3333.
