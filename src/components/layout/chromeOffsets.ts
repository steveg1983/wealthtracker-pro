 * ─ WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * These began life inside `components/Layout.tsx`, which is the right place for
 * them right up until a PAGE needs one. Layout renders the router's `Outlet`,
 * so every page is downstream of it; a page importing back from Layout closes
 * a cycle, and an ES module in a cycle hands out its bindings before it has
 * evaluated them. Measured, when `Accounts` imported the sticky offset from
 * Layout directly: `ReferenceError: STICKY_UNDER_APP_BAR is not defined`, the
 * page dead behind the error boundary.
 *
 * Note what did NOT catch that — `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck:strict`
 * both passed, because a cycle is legal TypeScript and legal ESM. Only loading
 * the page found it. A leaf module with no component imports cannot be part of
 * such a cycle, which is the whole reason this file exists.

 *
 * `index.html` asks for `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style:
 * black-translucent` with `viewport-fit=cover`, and that pairing means exactly
 * what it says: once the app is installed to a home screen, the page is drawn
 * UNDER the status bar rather than beneath it. In a browser tab the inset
 * resolves to 0px, so it only pays out where the status bar actually overlaps.
 *
 * Since iOS 26.1 the installed app is NOT drawn under the status bar — the
 * system insets the webview behind its own opaque bar and still reports the
 * full env() value, so paying it out here doubled the space. The named inset
 * below is env() in a browser and 0px in standalone; the ruling and the
 * revert condition live on `--wt-status-bar-inset` in index.css.
