/**
 * Find duplicates — the same sweep shape as "Match transfers", for the other
 * commonest mess in real data: one payment recorded twice.
 *
 * It is a DELETE tool, so it is built the other way round from every other
 * sweep in the app: nothing is bulk-applied, nothing is pre-selected, and the
 * user has to say which of the two copies goes. The scan cannot know which one
 * is the real one — one may be reconciled, categorised or carry a note the
 * other does not — so it never guesses.
 *
 * The scan finds in two tiers (see utils/duplicateSweep), and this screen keeps
 * them apart on purpose. Pairs whose WORDING agrees as well as their money are
 * near-certain. Pairs found only because the money and the day agree are
 * evidence: a renamed payee looks exactly like that, and so do two separate
 * payments of the same size. Those carry an extra confirmation that the user
 * has to give pair by pair — and the button is gated by
 * `deleteRefusalFor`, not by this component's opinion, so the rule holds
 * wherever it is asked from.
 *
 * Three shapes of row are refused outright, with the reason said out loud
 * rather than the row being quietly hidden (see utils/duplicateSweep):
 * deleting one would leave something else in the ledger pointing at nothing.
 * The user still needs to know the two rows look identical — they can unpick
 * the transfer or the split themselves and come back.
 *
 * Every row here also has a way OUT to itself — the register, centred on the
 * row, where the neighbours and the running balance are. Two evidence cards
 * cannot settle every case ("is this the standing order or the manual one?"),
 * and the answer is usually in the rows around it. See `openInRegister`.
