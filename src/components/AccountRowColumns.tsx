/**
 * The ONE column definition the Accounts list's rows share.
 *
 * ─ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The list draws two kinds of row: a top-level account card, and — for an
 * investment↔cash pair (the Microsoft Money model) — a nested cash row inside
 * it. They showed the same figures under the same headings, and each laid them
 * out its own way: the card on a nine-column grid, the cash row on a flex line
 * with three hand-matched widths. So the two lines of figures did not line up,
 * and every later change to one of them had to be remembered into the other.
 *
 * Matching the numbers up again would have fixed today's misalignment and left
 * tomorrow's in place. What stops them drifting is that neither row owns a
 * column definition any more: both render <AccountRowColumns>, which is the
 * only place the template lives, and both fill it with the cells below in the
 * same order. A figure can only move for one row by moving for the other.
 *
 * ─ THE COLUMNS, LEFT TO RIGHT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1 Bank Bal      what the bank last said (empty for a row with no feed)
 *   2 Account Bal   what the ledger says
 *   3 Unreconciled  how many rows have not been agreed with the bank
 *   4 To Review     how many freshly-imported rows nobody has dealt with
 *   5–9             five action slots, always all five, so the buttons in
 *                   them land at the same x on every card whether or not a
 *                   given account has that action (portfolio, bank feed,
 *                   settings, reconcile, close).
 *
 * A row that has nothing for a column renders <AccountRowEmptyCell /> rather
 * than dropping the column: an omitted cell pulls everything to its right one
 * place along, which is precisely the alignment this file exists to keep.
 *
 * ─ PHONES, AND WHY THE GRID STARTS AT `lg` AND NOT AT `sm` ─────────────────
 * Below the breakpoint the grid gives way to a wrapping row: the figures take
 * one line and the buttons the next. The balance is shown beside the account
 * NAME at that width instead (where a banking app puts it), which is why
 * AccountBalanceCell can be asked to keep itself off small screens rather than
 * saying it twice.
 *
 * That breakpoint was `sm` (640px) until 2026-08-14, and it was too low by a
 * whole class of device. The grid's tracks are FIXED — 104 + 120 + 88 + 88 +
 * five 48s, plus gaps — so it cannot be squeezed; it can only overflow. Turn a
 * phone on its side and the viewport is 844px, comfortably past `sm`, so a
 * landscape phone was handed the desktop table: measured at 844x390, the rows
 * wanted 915px and the page scrolled sideways by 95. The owner's report was
 * the plain version of that: "in landscape it should all fit in a page width
 * and I should not have to scroll right to look at anything."
 *
 * `lg` (1024px) is the first width where the whole template genuinely fits, so
 * it is where it now begins. Everything that dresses the grid moves with it —
 * the per-row labels that hide when the column strip takes over, the strip
 * itself, the balance cell's small-screen twin, and the empty spacer cells —
 * because a grid at one breakpoint and its captions at another is how a row
 * ends up with both, or neither.

/**
 * The look of a row the user has picked out, echoing the register's own active
 * row (.selected-transaction-row in index.css): the same blue wash, the same
 * #6B86B3 ring, the same two-layer elevation that lifts the row off the page.
 *
 * Echoed in utilities rather than by wearing that class, because three of its
 * declarations belong to a table row and not to a card: a forced `margin: 4px 0`
 * would fight the list's own spacing (and make a card twitch as it is selected),
 * `border-radius: 12px` would square off the card's 16px corners, and
 * `font-weight: 600` would embolden every word on the card rather than mark it.
 * What is left — colour, ring, lift — is the part that means "this one", and it
 * is what is copied here.
 *
 * ─ WHY `border-transparent` IS IN A LIST OF SELECTION COLOURS ───────────────
 * Because a row wears a 1px `border` at every moment of its life — the width is
 * geometry, held constant so a card cannot jump 1px as it is picked out — and a
 * border with no colour of its own does not stay invisible. Tailwind's preflight
 * gives every element `border-color: #e5e7eb`, so a selected row that named no
 * colour drew that near-white hairline on three sides while the fourth kept the
 * list's divider (#e2e6ed light, gray-700 dark) — a second and third tone packed
 * against the ring, which is the "two colours in the border" the owner saw. It
 * is worst in dark mode, where #e5e7eb is a light-mode grey sitting on a dark
 * card. Naming the colour transparent here leaves the ring as the only stroke
 * the row draws, uniform on all four sides.
 *
 * This is a state's OWN colour rather than a fight with the base class: the row
 * that is NOT selected names `border-transparent border-b-line …` for itself
 * (see Accounts.tsx). Neither state has to outrank the other in a cascade whose
 * order between `border-*`, `border-b-*`, `last:` and `dark:` is Tailwind's to
 * decide and not ours to depend on.

  // concentric strokes: this SELECTION ring, and — 2px further out — the
  // app-wide `*:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--focus-ring-color) }`
  // in accessibility-colors.css, which carries `!important` and so cannot be
  // turned off by the row's own `focus:outline-none`. Light mode resolves that
  // variable to the brand navy, which is why it read as "a blue and a black
  // double border". Clicking never showed it, because a click does not match
  // :focus-visible — so the same row looked clean by mouse and doubled by
  // keyboard.
  //
  // The FOCUS outline is the one kept, deliberately: it is the app's single
  // focus indicator, it is what every other control uses, and it is the stroke
  // with a contrast obligation (WCAG 2.4.11). The selection ring stands down
  // while the row holds focus and comes back the moment focus leaves — and the
  // blue wash and the lift never go anywhere, so a selected row still reads as
  // selected either way.
  //
  // THIS ONE SURVIVED THE APP-WIDE SWEEP, and it is the only `ring-0` left.
  // Every component-level `focus-visible:ring-*` came out in
  // RULINGS_ON_CAUSE_2026-08-13 §3, on the grounds that a component declaring
  // its own ring paints a second one over the global outline. The ruling
  // expected this workaround to come out with them as having "nothing left to
  // fight" — but what it suppresses is not a focus ring. It is the `ring-1`
  // selection indicator on the SAME element, three classes to its left, which
  // is §6 law and stays. Delete this and a selected, arrowed-to row wears both
  // strokes again, which is the exact bug that was reported.

  // 28 Aug 2026 stock-blue ruling; the argument about the two strokes is

/**
 * The account NAME as a link — one definition, worn by both kinds of row.
 *
 * ─ WHY IT HUGS ITS OWN TEXT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The name opens the register and the rest of the row picks the row out. That
 * division only holds if the link's HIT AREA ends where the letters end. As a
 * plain `block` (what shipped) the anchor filled its whole flex track, so a
 * click in what looks like empty row a hand's width right of a short name still
 * landed on the link and opened the account — the hover underline and the
 * "Open …" tooltip appearing under a cursor nowhere near the text. `w-fit`
 * (width: fit-content) is the cure: the box is as wide as the name and no
 * wider, at whatever length that name happens to be. Everything past the last
 * character is row background, and row background selects.
 *
 * ─ THE OTHER THREE ARE NOT DECORATION ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `block`      an inline <a> cannot be clipped at all (overflow does not apply
 *              to a non-replaced inline box), so a long name could not ellipse.
 * `max-w-full` fit-content of a nowrap line is the FULL text width however long
 *              it runs, so without a cap a long name would sail out over the
 *              figures to its right instead of truncating.
 * `truncate`   the ellipsis itself — which only has an edge to break against
 *              because of the cap above.
 * Drop any one of the four and either the hit area or the truncation goes.
 *
 * ─ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN HERE ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The type/wallet icon beside the name stays OUTSIDE the link. Clicking an
 * item's icon to open it is a fair convention, but the rule this page can then
 * state in one line — "the letters open it, anything else on the row picks it
 * out" — is worth more than the extra few pixels, and a decorative type glyph
 * is not the account's name.
 *
 * Resting colour is the caller's (a nested cash row is drawn quieter than the
 * card it sits in); the geometry and the hover are shared, so the hit area
 * cannot come out right for one kind of row and wrong for the other. The link
 * declares NO focus ring: it used to carry `focus:outline-none
 * focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-blue-500`, which painted a blue ring
 * INSIDE the app-wide focus outline — the same doubling the selected row above
 * had to work around. The global outline is the app's one focus ring
 * (RULINGS_ON_CAUSE_2026-08-13 §3), and `rounded` is kept because the outline
 * follows the border radius.
 *
 * On touch, index.css floors every anchor at 44×44 — a hit area small enough to
 * miss is its own failure, and 44px beside a four-letter name is still nothing
 * like the full width of the row.

  // The same trap as the count pill, two rows down. `index.css` floors every
  // `a` at 44px tall on a touch device, so this link's box was 44 while the
  // balance beside it was 24 — and the row centres both, which put the two
  // texts 10px apart. Measured at 390px before the fix: link 708→752, balance
  // 718→742. The owner: "the account name sits higher than the amount on the
  // right hand side."
  //
  // `min-h-0` gives the box back its own height so the two line up; the thumb
  // keeps its 44px through `touch-target-small`, the app's own opt-in, which
  // spends no layout to do it. `font-semibold` because he asked for both to be
  // bold — the name and the figure are one statement, and the name was the
  // quieter half at 500 against the balance's 600.

  // ─ THE HOVER IS AN UNDERLINE AND NOTHING ELSE ──────────────────────────────

  // blue this app retired on 28 Aug 2026. The ruling's answer for in-app
  // navigation is the PAIR `text-primary hover:text-secondary` — but this link
  // deliberately declines a resting colour (see above: a nested cash row is
  // drawn quieter than the card it sits in, and `.text-primary` carries
  // `!important`, so naming it here would overrule both callers' ink). The
  // hover half alone cannot be taken either: `.dark .text-secondary`'s lift is
  // on the resting class, so `hover:text-secondary` would darken a near-white
  // name to navy on a gray-800 card on hover.
  //
  // So the underline is the whole hover, which is what it was carrying anyway —
  // an underline IS the link (see design-system/linkBlue.ts), and a colour

 * 'Bank Bal' and 'To Review'."
 *
 * Both halves were one cause. A count with work in it became a LINK when the

 * `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px` — a floor meant for thumbs, applied to a

 * was being inflated from outside, by a rule that never matches a desktop
 * browser — the same media block that once put the floating + button at the
 * left edge of the screen.
 *
 * The fix is the owner's own second option — "increase the default height of
 * everything else on the same row" — because it is the one that cannot come

 * a state with a different height. A shared line height means a figure may be

   * and not round" — and it stayed faintly oval even after the 44px floor was
   * lifted, because a width of `min-w + padding` lands wherever the digits put
   * it: 31 across against 24 down for two digits.
   *
   * So one and two digits get a FIXED 24x24 — a real disc, the shape that was
   * asked for and the shape a count badge is everywhere else. Three digits and
   * up keep the padded form and become a lozenge, which is the honest answer:
   * 130 does not fit in a 24px circle, and squeezing it would either shrink the
   * type or clip it. The break is at 100 because that is where the width has to
   * give, not because of anything about the number.

  /* THE PILL FLIPS IN DARK (owner, 16 August). `bg-primary` is the near-black
     navy: the right "attend to this" mark on a white row, and a circle you can
     barely see on a gray-800 one — the count read as white digits floating on
     nothing. Dark inverts it: the light ground with navy digits, the same
     relationship the other way up, and the same reason the band totals swap
     ink rather than keep it.

     `bg-[#1a2332]`, NOT `bg-primary`: index.css gives `.bg-primary` an
     `!important`, which beats any `dark:` variant however specific — the same
     mechanism that blanked the grey text app-wide this morning. The literal
     hex is the same colour without the landmine. */

         * direction or an alarm. It is also the shape ActivityBadge already
         * uses for a count that carries a figure, so the app has one idiom for
         * this rather than two.
         *
         * The ZERO is untouched by all of it: still plain, still light, still
         * receding. Ruling A's correction — that nothing is not something to
         * attend to — is exactly why the contrast between the two can be this
         * strong without the zero shouting.
