/**
 * ─ THE ROW IS THE EDITOR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Highlighting a row in the register turns the row itself into the form: the
 * Date cell becomes a date picker, the Description cell a text box, the
 * Category cell a combobox — each still in its own column, still under its own
 * header, still the width the user dragged it to. Underneath sits a slim strip
 * carrying Save & Next, Save, the × and the hint (and Confirm, when the
 * category is only the app's guess).
 *
 * It used to be a card BELOW the row that repeated Date, Description and
 * Category as a second set of fields — so the same three values appeared twice,
 * one line apart, in different places and at different widths, and the eye had
 * to work out which of the two it was reading. The owner: make the row itself
 * the editor. There is nothing to reconcile now, because there is only one of
 * each value on screen.
 *
 * Payment, Deposit, Balance, R and Tags stay as they read. Amounts belong to
 * the full editor — one editor per thing, and a register you can retype a
 * balance into is a register nobody can trust.
 *
 * ─ THE RHYTHM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Filing a statement is the same edit made a hundred times, so the keyboard is
 * shaped around REPEATING one field rather than around finishing one row:
 *
 *   type → Enter (accepts what you typed, and hands you Save & Next)
 *        → Enter (saves, moves to the next row, cursor back in the SAME field)
 *
 * which means a run of categories is: type, Enter, Enter, type, Enter, Enter…
 * without the hand ever leaving the keyboard or the eye leaving the line.
 * Save — the other button — ends the run: it saves, closes the editor, and
 * gives the list back the keyboard so the arrows work again. Escape closes
 * without saving. Both leave the row that was being edited still highlighted.
 *
 * ─ WHY A PROVIDER AND TWO CONSUMERS ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The editor is now spread across two places the table renders — cells inside
 * the row, and a strip in the row's detail — and one component cannot render
 * into two disjoint places. So the state, the keys and the writes live in a
 * provider mounted ABOVE the table, and the cells and the strip read them from
 * context.
 *
 * That the provider sits above the table rather than inside it is not
 * incidental. Typing in the description must not re-render eleven thousand
 * rows: the provider re-renders, its children element is the same object, React
 * bails out of the table, and only the three cells and the strip — its
 * consumers — are redrawn. The provider is also mounted ALWAYS, editor or no
 * editor, because a wrapper that comes and goes changes the type of the tree
 * beneath it, and this register has already been through what that does to a
 * virtualised list (see VirtualizedTable's note on component identity).
 */

   * one, save-and-move-on, land in the same field, carry on typing.
   *
   * Two things own Enter before this does —
   *
   *   - an OPEN category list, where Enter chooses the highlighted option. It
   *     prevents the default, and the choice itself hands the cursor over (see
   *     chooseCategory); an Enter that matched nothing is left alone, because
   *     yanking the cursor out of a search that found nothing is the opposite
   *     of helpful;
   *   - a BUTTON, where Enter is the press. Save, Save & Next and Confirm all
   *     do their own thing with it, and running this handler as well would
   *     write the transaction twice in one keystroke.
   *
   * The DATE field is the third, and it is the one exception: it settles a
   * half-typed date and shuts its calendar on its own Enter, marking the key
   * handled — but settling IS the accept, so the cursor moves on from there
   * exactly as it does from the description.
   *
   * ESCAPE closes the editor, one layer at a time. An open menu or calendar
   * answers its own Escape first and stops it here; only an Escape nothing else
   * wanted means "I'm done with this row" — and the register then takes the
   * layer after that (a stretched selection, then the highlight itself).
   *

   * of the row and the buttons are a strip beneath it.

   * ─ THE TRANSFER PROMPT, AND WHY IT IS A STRIP AND NOT A DIALOG ────────────
   *
   * Committing a transfer from the row editor has to ask one question: is the
   * other side already in that account, or should we make it? The full editor
   * asks it in a modal, which is right there — that flow is one transaction at
   * a time and the modal is already the thing on screen.
   *
   * Here it would be wrong, and the reason is the run. This editor exists so a
   * statement can be filed at "type, Enter, Enter" without the hand leaving the
   * keyboard or the eye leaving the line. A modal takes the screen, takes the
   * focus out of the strip, and puts the row being worked on behind an overlay
   * — after which the next Enter goes somewhere the user has to look for. So
   * the question is asked in the 36px that is already there, in the place the
   * cursor already is, and the cursor lands on the answer that is nearly always
   * right.
   *
   * ─ WHY NOT AUTO-CREATE, WHICH WOULD BE FASTER STILL ───────────────────────
   * Because both silent answers are wrong in a way the user cannot see.
   * Creating the other side writes a real row into another account and moves
   * that account's balance; doing it without a word, in the one flow whose
   * whole point is speed, is how a register acquires a row nobody remembers.
   * Auto-LINKING is worse: findTransferCandidates treats the description as a
   * TIE-BREAKER only — the two banks never word it the same — so its top
   * candidate is "the nearest date with an exactly opposite amount", and on a
   * swept account that is a coin toss between several real transactions.
   *
   * One keypress is the honest price, and it is one keypress: Enter.
