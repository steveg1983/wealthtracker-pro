 * What you can do with several selected rows, and what each would change.
 *
 * It takes the dock's place while a multi-row selection is up, because the
 * quick editor below the register edits ONE transaction and showing it beside
 * a selection of nine would be a lie about what Save was going to touch.
 *
 * Every button says how many rows it would actually affect rather than how
 * many are selected: "Reconcile 4" on a selection of nine means five are
 * reconciled already, which is worth knowing before pressing it. A button
 * with nothing to do is disabled and says why.
 *
 * The four actions are deliberately all there is. Anything that rewrites what
 * a transaction MEANS — its category, its amount, its payee — stays a
 * one-row-at-a-time job in the editor, where the whole row is on screen.
