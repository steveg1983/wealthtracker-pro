                Your final pension fund and the income available will depend on a number of factors including:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-2 space-y-1">
                <li>Fund performance, contributions made, charges, inflation</li>
                <li>Your retirement age and the amount you withdraw from your pensions</li>
                <li>Tax rules and mortality rates</li>
                <li>Annuity rates at the time you retire (if purchasing an annuity)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Investment risks:</strong> As with all investments, the value can fall as well as rise, 
                therefore you may get back less than you invest. Past performance is not a guide to future performance.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Assumptions:</strong> We have used an expected growth rate of 5-7% p.a. which is the expected 
                return of our growth portfolio modelled on current market conditions. This includes a fund charge of 
                0.11% p.a. and inflation of 2.9% p.a. Other charges may apply which may affect the value of your 
                pension and the amount of income available.

              <p>
                <strong>State Pension:</strong> The state pension shown is based on the current full new State Pension 
                for the 2024/25 tax year. Your actual state pension may be higher or lower than this figure. 
                The state pension age shown is based on current legislation and may change.

                apply to withdrawals or to contributions that exceed your allowances. Prevailing tax rates and reliefs 
                depend on your individual circumstances and are subject to change.

                Regular contributions are assumed to be personal contributions increased in line with inflation and
