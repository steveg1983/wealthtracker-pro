/**
 * Five slots for the things you do on a phone. Budget and Goals used to hold
 * two of them: both are desk work — you sit down to plan, you don't plan in a
 * queue — and neither is something you reach for while standing in a shop.
 * Reconcile and Review are the opposite: they are the two chores that decide
 * whether the numbers can be trusted, and they are made of small decisions
 * that suit a phone. Budget and Goals keep their places in the menu.
 *
 * Home pointed at "/" until now, which is the public welcome page — a signed-in
 * user tapping Home got the marketing pitch. It points at the dashboard, which
 * is what the desktop nav has always meant by Home.
 *
 * Labels are 11px with no slot padding because that is what measurement said,
 * not taste: at 375px each of five slots gives the text 63px at 12px type, and
 * "Transactions" needed 72px — it rendered as "Transactio…" for as long as it
 * was here. At 11px with the padding removed every label fits whole. The full
 * word "Categorisation" does not fit at any size tried (83px), hence the verb,
 * which also matches "Reconcile".
 *
 * The third slot was Transactions, the global list, which is retired: on a
 * phone you either open the account you are looking at (Accounts) or you are
 * hunting for one row, which is Find. Nothing browses fifty thousand rows on a
 * phone, which is what that slot offered.

        A FLOATING PILL, not a bar welded to the bottom edge — the owner sent
        Instagram's and asked for "our icons in a floating toolbar". It is the
        same five destinations and the same labels; what changed is that the
        chrome stops pretending to be part of the device.

        ─ THE QUICK-ADD IS INSIDE IT NOW ──────────────────────────────────────
        It used to be a 3.5rem navy circle floating ABOVE the bar, and two
        stacked round things in one corner is exactly what the pill shape stops
        looking calm about. Folding it in also pays for itself twice over: the
        page's bottom reservation was `5 (nav) + 3.5 (button) + 1 (air)`, and
        the button's share of that is now given back to every mobile page.

        ─ POSITIONED BY INLINE STYLE, DELIBERATELY ────────────────────────────
        The button this replaces carried a hard-won comment: on the owner's
        actual device its positioning UTILITIES were not applied — it rendered
        against the left edge while every desktop browser put it bottom-right —
        and an inline style was what fixed it. Whatever ate those classes, a
        floating pill depends on exactly the same four properties, so it takes
        the same precaution rather than rediscovering the bug on his phone.
