/**
 * Phone notifications — what this phone may interrupt its owner for.
 *
 * Drawn ONLY inside the iOS shell (services/push/nativeShell.ts): a browser
 * has no APNs token and no way to get one, so a switch there would be a
 * claim the app cannot keep. On the web the card is simply absent, the way
 * the desktop edition's absent panels are absent — a person on a settings
 * page did not come there to read about a device they are not holding.
 *
 * Three switches, each honest about what it needs:
 *
 *   New transactions      needs Bank feed refresh = In the cloud, because
 *   A feed stopped        only a SERVER-side sync can notice something while
 *                         the app is closed — a browser sync shows its own
 *                         toast and has nobody to push to.
 *   Balance reminders     needs In the cloud TOO (the owner's ruling, 11
 *                         Sep: phone alerts are what a cloud user opts
 *                         into, one decision rather than three), and a
 *                         schedule in the card above — a reminder with no
 *                         moment has nothing to say. The server keeps the
 *                         same rule (api/_lib/reminder-push.ts), so a
 *                         switch left on by a user who later leaves cloud
 *                         mode goes quiet rather than lingering.
 *
 * A disabled switch says why in a line beneath it rather than vanishing:
 * the remedy is one card up, and naming it is what makes the pair one
 * setting rather than two that happen to agree.
 *
 * Switching anything on is what asks iOS for permission — Apple's own
 * prompt, shown once. A refusal is remembered by the system, and the only
 * way back is iOS Settings, so that is what the card says when it finds
 * notifications off: the words, not a button that would do nothing.
