/**
 * PHONE NOTIFICATIONS — the card that exists only where a push can.
 *
 * Two facts worth holding still. Outside the iOS shell the card is ABSENT,
 * not disabled: a browser has no APNs token and a switch there would be a
 * claim the app cannot keep. Inside it, a switch whose precondition is unmet
 * says which card above supplies it, rather than vanishing.
 *
 * Clerk is answered signed-in here (the suite-wide stub in test/setup.ts
 * answers signed-out, which would hide the card for the wrong reason); the
 * database id and the native plugin are stubbed because both are bridges to
 * things a test runner does not have — a Postgres row and iOS. No service is
 * mocked.
