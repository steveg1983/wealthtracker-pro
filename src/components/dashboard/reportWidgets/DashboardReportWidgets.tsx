/**
 * Compact, live versions of the Reports-hub reports for the Dashboard's
 * "pinned reports" section. Each widget computes from the SAME shared maths
 * as its full report (utils/monthlyTrend, utils/netWorthSeries,
 * utils/categoryNetting), so the glance and the full view can never
 * disagree.
 *
 * Every card clicks through to ITS report in the gallery — the ids below are
 * the report gallery's stable URL segments (see pages/reports/reportRegistry).
 * The click carries TWO things it used to drop on the floor: the period the
 * card was read over, so the report opens on the same window rather than on
 * whatever it last stored; and where the user came from, so the report's
 * back-link returns to the Dashboard (see useReportDrill).
 *
 * Clicking a point rather than the header carries the point as well, and the
 * report lands on it. What "lands on it" means is the report's own business —
 * the month-by-month table highlights the month, the net-worth line opens that
 * day's balances — which is why the widgets pass a token and nothing else.
 *
 * Every chart area is WIDGET_CHART_HEIGHT and every card wears the same shell,
 * so the four cards in the section are one height rather than four.
 *
 * ── `picker` AND `pin` ARE NOT TWO WINDOWS ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `picker` is the window the card is read over, whether that is the page's or
 * one this card was pinned to; the Dashboard resolves which before handing it
 * over (hooks/useCardPeriod). `pin` carries no window at all — only whether
 * this card has one of its own and the two ways to change that — so the card's
 * chart, its click-through and its declaration cannot disagree about the
 * window, because there is only one of them to read.
 *
 * `pin` is optional: a card rendered without it is a card with no period
 * affordance, which is exactly what these three were before the pin existed.
