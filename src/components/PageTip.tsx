 * ─ Versioning the id ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A dismissal is permanent for that browser, so anyone who has read a tip
 * will never see it again — including after it is corrected. When a tip's
 * MEANING changes (the page now does something different, or the tip was
 * wrong), bump its id: `dashboard-welcome` → `dashboard-welcome-2`. The new
 * id has no stored dismissal, so the corrected tip is shown once more.
 * Cosmetic edits — wording, punctuation, a clearer verb — keep the same id;
 * re-showing a tip nobody needs re-read is just noise.
 * Settings ▸ App Settings ▸ Page Tips brings back every dismissed tip.

  // Mobile offset: the bottom nav is ~78px tall and its quick-action button
  // floats above that to ~136px, both at z-50. Sitting the tip clear of them
  // (bottom-36 = 144px) keeps it fully readable and its dismiss button
  // tappable WITHOUT covering the navigation — which would only trade one
  // hidden control for another. Desktop is unchanged: bottom-right, over the
