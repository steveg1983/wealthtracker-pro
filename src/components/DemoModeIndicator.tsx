 * How far everything pinned to the top of the window has to move down to clear
 * the demo banner.
 *
 * WHY a CSS variable rather than a shared constant: the banner is the only
 * thing that knows how tall it is. Its height comes from its own text at
 * whatever the viewport width happens to be, so a hard-coded 40px would be a
 * guess that goes wrong the first time the copy wraps. Publishing the measured
 * height means the headers offset by exactly the right amount and, crucially,
 * the variable is simply ABSENT outside demo mode — every consumer falls back
 * to 0px and the normal layout is untouched.
