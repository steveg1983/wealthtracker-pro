/**
 * THE BUDGET WIZARD — three questions, one apply.
 *
 * The owner's ruling (31 Aug 2026): a budget is a PROPERTY of a category, not
 * a separate object that shares its name. There is one object and two lenses
 * onto it — Manage → Categories says WHAT IS SET, the Budget page says HOW IT
 * IS GOING — and this is the door that writes them in bulk.
 *
 * Storage is unchanged: the `budgets` table, keyed by category_id, the same
 * rows the Budget page has always read. The unification is in the UI, which is
 * why there is no migration attached to any of this.
 *
 * ── WHY THREE STEPS AND NOT ONE SCREEN ─────────────────────────────────────
 * This replaces a single-screen version of the same job. The steps exist
 * because the three questions are of genuinely different kinds and mixing them
 * is what made the one screen hard to finish:
 *
 *   1. HOW DO YOU THINK? Months or years. Asked once, for the whole screen,
 *      because a page mixing £500-a-month rows with £6,000-a-year rows cannot
 *      be totalled or compared — and totalling is most of what step 3 is for.
 *      It chooses only which column takes TYPING; both figures are always
 *      shown on every row, and changing your mind CONVERTS what you have
 *      already typed rather than re-reading it (owner, 2 Sep 2026: "Yes, it
 *      should convert") — see `chooseMode` and utils/budgetWizardPlan.
 *   2. THE GRID. Evidence beside every box: what that category really cost
 *      over twelve complete months, as a year and as a month.
 *   3. WHAT WILL HAPPEN. The totals, the shortfall or headroom in words, and
 *      every removal named — before a single row is written.
 *
 * ── EMPTY IS NOT ZERO, AND THAT SURVIVES TO THE WRITE ──────────────────────
 * Boxes start EMPTY with the historical figure greyed beside them. An empty
 * box means UNBUDGETED; a typed 0 means "I intend to spend nothing here",
 * which is a real budget somebody can be over. Clearing a box that arrived
 * pre-filled REMOVES that budget, and step 3 says which ones by name — the
 * arithmetic for all of it is in `utils/budgetWizardPlan`, tested away from
 * any screen, because a rule this load-bearing should not live in a component
 * that also has to lay out a grid.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It never saves a figure nobody typed: "use last 12 months" fills the box,
 * visibly and editably, rather than writing behind you. It never invents a
 * budget on a parent group (that would double-count against its children), it
 * never re-expresses a weekly or quarterly budget as a monthly one (that
 * conversion is a guess), and it never touches alert thresholds — new budgets
 * take the app-wide default, edited ones keep whatever they had, because this
 * screen does not ask about them and must not answer for you.

/**
 * The shaded band a group heading is drawn on (owner, 1 Sep 2026: "category
 * group headings … shaded a different colour to show sections"), one class per
 * column. `renderGroupHeading` is the only thing that wears these and carries
 * the reasoning for why the shade is on the cells at all; what is settled here
 * is the PADDING, which is load-bearing in three separate ways.
 *
 * A content-box background stops at the padding, so on every edge INSIDE the
 * row — the three seams between the cells, and the join between the two lines
 * a phone folds them into — the padding has to be nothing, or the band shows a
 * hairline of the modal's ground through it. That is what `px-0`, `pl-0`,
 * `pr-0`, `pb-0` and the `pt-0` on the folding pair are for; measured, not
 * assumed, because a browser gives every table cell 1px of padding that
 * nothing in this stylesheet resets, and 1px of white is perfectly visible
 * across a shaded bar.
 *
 * At the row's two OUTER ends that same 1px is left exactly where the browser
 * put it, because the data cells and the column headers leave theirs too — so
 * the name starts and the twin ends on the same pixel as every figure above
 * and below them. The horizontal insets then come from the inner divs rather
 * than the cells, matching each data cell's own padding, which is what makes
 * the band's figures land in their columns instead of near them.
 *
 * And the top: `pt-4` holds the breathing room open ABOVE each section, unshaded,
 * because that padding is outside a content-box background — the one trick that
 * lets a single band be both full-bleed and preceded by the modal's own ground.
 * Only the leading pair carries it: on a phone the other two fold underneath,
 * where a gap would cut the band in half.
 *
 * A word on the greys inside it. The data rows put their quieter figures in
 * gray-400/500, which is legible on the modal's white but not on this band — so
 * the band's own text is a step or two darker. Contrast is measured against the
 * surface the text sits on, never the page it sits in.

   *
   * So the heading answers the same four columns its children do: the name,
   * what the group cost, what has been budgeted across it so far, and that
   * total's twin. A figure under a column heading now means what the heading
   * says — which is the whole of the fix. It cost the bar its rounded ends:
   * something with columns to line up with cannot also be inset from them.
   *
   * THE SHADE IS ON THE CELLS, clipped to their content boxes, which is the
   * one arrangement that does both jobs at once: an unbroken band across four
   * cells AND the breathing room above each section left as the modal's own
   * ground. What that costs in padding is settled in BAND_* above. On a phone
   * the four cells fold two-by-two like every other row here, and the band
   * closes over both of its lines.

   * NO "n of m filled" COUNT. It would sit in a desktop cell and crowd a
   * phone's, and the scoreboard above already says it for the whole screen.
   *
   * DISPLAY ONLY, and structurally so — there is still no input in it. A
