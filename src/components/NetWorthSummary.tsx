/**
 * Net worth and its two components, as ONE card.
 *
 * ─ WHY IT IS ONE CARD ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both surfaces that show these three figures used to draw them as a navy slab
 * plus two white cards — one important thing and two afterthoughts, when what
 * is actually on screen is one figure and the two halves it is made of
 * (DESIGN_PASS_2026-08 §3.3, §3.4). Assets minus liabilities IS net worth, so
 * the three sit in one card, three columns, separated by hairlines rather than
 * by gaps between separate boxes.
 *
 * The dark slab went with it. A full-bleed navy panel under a navy nav bar puts
 * two heavy horizontals at the top of the page, and it forces a second
 * text-colour system (white-on-navy) to exist for one card. The figure is
 * already the largest thing on the page — per P1 it does not need a panel
 * behind it to say so.
 *
 * ─ WHY IT IS SHARED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The Accounts list and the Dashboard show the same three numbers. Two copies
 * of this markup is two things to keep in step, and they had already drifted
 * into different colours, sizes and shapes. One definition means the two
 * surfaces cannot disagree about what net worth looks like.
 *
 * ─ CURRENCY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * All three values are formatted by the caller in the DISPLAY currency (the
 * preference), never in any one account's own — a total over accounts that do
 * not share a currency belongs to none of them. Individual account rows keep
 * showing their own currency; that split is deliberate and is what settles the
 * mismatch between the summary and the rows below it.

   * that cannot take plainer words is a card that enforces jargon.
   *
   * They exist as props at all because the net-worth STATEMENT report had
   * already chosen the plainer words for itself, and converting it to this card
   * would otherwise have silently overwritten somebody's word choice. That is a
   * content decision, and a refactor is not allowed to make it.

  /**
   * ALL THREE figures are navy. None of them is a direction of travel.
   *
   * This card used to argue the point for one cell and then contradict itself
   * in the next two: net worth was navy because "net worth is the answer, not a
   * direction of travel, and the sign in front of it says which way it went"
   * — and then Assets rendered in `text-income` and Liabilities in
   * `text-expense`. But Assets is a magnitude, exactly as net worth is. So is
   * Liabilities. The reasoning was written down and applied to one cell in
   * three (RULINGS_ON_CAUSE_2026-08-13 §1).
   *
   * What the inconsistency cost is not on this card, it is everywhere else:
   * green and red mean money in and money out, and spending them on two
   * standing magnitudes makes them quieter in the register, where direction is
   * the whole point (P2 — colour is a signal, never a surface).
   *
   * Hierarchy is carried by SIZE, not colour — `display` for the headline,
   * `page` for the two components it is made of. That is the same job the old
   * navy slab was doing with a background, and it still works with every cell
   * the same colour.
   *
   * ─ WHY `text-gray-900` AND NOT `text-primary` ──────────────────────────────
   * index.css locks `.text-primary { color: var(--color-primary) !important }`,
   * and `!important` beats a `dark:` variant whatever its specificity. So
   * `text-primary dark:text-white` — which is what the net worth cell actually
   * shipped — never flipped: MEASURED in the running app, the figure computed
   * to #1a2332 on the #1f2937 dark card, a contrast of 1.08:1. Net worth was
   * invisible in dark mode, and applying that class to the other two cells
   * would have made all three so.
   * The app's documented way out (see SimpleSignIn) is that anything which
   * must flip for dark mode uses the neutral gray tokens, which are not
   * locked. `text-gray-900` is #111827 against the brand's #1a2332 — the same
   * near-black navy to the eye, and the colour the rest of the app's headline
   * figures already use.
