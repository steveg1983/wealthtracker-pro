   * `marketValue`, `costBasis`, `units`, `expectedAmount`, `actualAmount` and
   * `discrepancy` were declared `number` — that is, money and rates held as

   * in services/api/transactionService.ts skipped the key outright, so every
   * value assigned to it was dropped on the way to the database.
   *
   * It was not merely dead, it was a trap: the obvious place for a future
   * implementer to put an exchange rate, in the one representation this
   * codebase forbids for money. The local edition had already reached the same
   * verdict from the other side — `scripts/local-sqlite/schema.sql` promotes
   * that money into typed integer columns and then BANS all ten keys from the
   * blob by CHECK constraint, naming each one.
   *
   * ── WHAT GOES IN HERE INSTEAD ───────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Opaque labels and references — never money, never a float. A cross-currency
   * transfer records its conversion under `fx` as an exact decimal STRING; see
   * `utils/fx.ts` for the shape and for why a string rather than a number.
   *
   * Declaring it is also what makes `DataPortTransactionWrites.updateTransaction`
   * honest: its contract lists `metadata` among the sixteen fields the engines
   * honour, and until this field existed that list named something
   * `Partial<Transaction>` could not carry.
   *
   * Not selected by either edition's BOOT projection, deliberately — see
