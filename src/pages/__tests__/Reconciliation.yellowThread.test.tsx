/**
 * "The yellow is wherever your next action is."
 *
 * ── THE DESIGN, IN ONE LINE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * While the closing balance is unconfirmed the app is ASKING, so the balance
 * bar's closing-balance affordance wears the yellow and Finalize sits dimmed
 * and disabled. Agree to the figure and the bar goes quiet while Finalize
 * lights up in the same yellow, because pressing it is now the only thing left
 * to do. The colour travels from the question to the action.
 *
 * It used to sit on BOTH at once, meaning "blocked". Live testing killed that:
 * two amber controls read as two separate refusals, and the user's actual next
 * step — Confirm, in quiet blue on the bar — was the least visible thing on
 * screen.
 *
 * ── WHY THESE TESTS ARE SHAPED LIKE THIS ────────────────────────────────────
 * They are structural, not cosmetic. They do not check that anything is
 * amber-100; they check WHICH element carries the shared token's exact amber
 * vocabulary, and that the other carries NONE — asserted as one object per
 * state so a failure names both sides at once. Two hand-maintained class lists
 * cannot satisfy that for long: hardcode a near-miss, forget to drop the token
 * on one branch, or paint both at once, and the comparison goes red before the
 * screen has to.
 *
 * Every name and figure here is invented: this repo is public.
