/**
 * A SIGNED-OUT PAGE CARRIES ITS OWN HEADER, AND NOTHING ELSE'S.
 *
 * The sign-in shell used to render inside the app's Layout, which put nine
 * controls — Dashboard, Accounts, Plan, Reports, Manage, Settings, search, a
 * bell, help — in front of a visitor who could use none of them (design
 * handover 29 Aug, §5.1: "Signed-out gets wordmark plus Sign in and nothing
 * else"). The route moved outside Layout; what this file holds in place is
 * that the page brings its own minimal header and never grows app chrome of
 * its own.
