/**
 * FIND — Microsoft Money's, not a second register.
 *
 * ─ WHAT IT IS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The work happens in an account's register. This view answers one question the
 * register cannot — "which account was that in?" — and then gets out of the
 * way: every row here is a way INTO a register, and nothing here edits, ticks,
 * reconciles, deletes or bulk-anythings. That is the whole reason it can exist
 * alongside the registers without becoming the second copy of them that the
 * retired global Transactions page was: two lists that both edit must both grow
 * every feature, forever, and one of them will always be the poor relation.
 *
 * ─ WHY IT IS NOT PAGED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It draws at most FIND_RESULT_CAP rows and states the true total. A user
 * paging through four thousand results is not finding anything; they are
 * browsing, which is what the register is for. See utils/findTransactions.
 *
 * ─ ONE LIST, NOT TWO ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The phone gets the same table with two columns dropped, not a card list of
 * its own. A second rendering is a second thing to keep true, and this batch is
 * about deleting exactly that kind of duplicate.
 */

/**
 * The look of the row the keyboard is on: the same blue wash and #6B86B3 ring
 * the register's active row wears (.selected-transaction-row in index.css), and
 * the same one the Accounts list echoes (ACCOUNT_ROW_SELECTED_CLASS).
 *
 * Utilities rather than that class, and the ring drawn on the CELLS rather than
 * the row, for the reasons the CSS table model forces: `margin` and
 * `border-radius` do nothing on a `<tr>`, a row's box-shadow is not painted
 * while borders are collapsing (Tailwind's preflight makes collapse the default
 * for every table here), and in the collapsing model the CELL's border is the
 * one that wins — so bordering the cells is the only way to draw one unbroken
 * outline round a row that survives its neighbour being selected too.
 *
 * No font-weight, deliberately: weight already says something on this list. A
 * row that arrived and has not been reviewed is bold (isAwaitingReview), and
 * emboldening the selected row would erase that mark exactly when the user is
 * looking straight at it.
