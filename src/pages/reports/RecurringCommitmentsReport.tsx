/**
 * "What I'm committed to" — recurring payments, detected from the register.
 *
 * A FINDING, not a dashboard (Claude Design handover, 17 Aug §1): the app
 * noticing something in the ledger the user hasn't. Two audiences in one —
 * the subscription audit ("what am I signed up to?") and the schedule read
 * ("what is due next?") — designed for the first, with the second falling
 * out of it.
 *
 * Lives under PLAN as its own page (owner's ruling, 18 Aug — the nav says
 * "Recurring Payments", the heading keeps the question), not in the Reports
 * gallery: confirming patterns here is what feeds the calendar and the
 * forecast, which makes it a working surface rather than a read-out.
 *
 * The design rules this page lives under, all from the handover:
 *
 * - A detection is an INFERENCE and carries its evidence in its resting
 *   state (§2): the payment count, the span, the most recent date and the
 *   next expected ARE the confidence. No percentages, ever. A stitched
 *   pattern names its former labels; a vouched pattern says the user's
 *   judgment is what admitted it.
 * - The number that lands is the ANNUAL equivalent (§3) — £14.99 a month is
 *   invisible; £179.88 a year is a decision.
 * - Grouped by CADENCE by default (§4); the user can regroup by institution
 *   (the Accounts page's idiom), search, and re-sort — navigation, never a
 *   change to what is claimed.
 * - A price change is a DIRECTION and may wear the hues; the magnitudes
 *   stay neutral (§3.1).
 * - Stopped patterns are a band, never a silent deletion (§3.2).
 * - Read-only over the register: verdicts live beside the detections
 *   (suggestion dismissals), never on the rows they were read from.
 *
 * No period picker: a rhythm needs the whole history to be seen, and a
 * window that hides half the payments would weaken every evidence line on
 * the page. Said on screen.
