        NetWorthSummary was written to abolish — and opting out of the shared
        card is not free. The dark-mode fault that card's comment documents was
        found and fixed ONCE and reached all three surfaces that use it; this
        page, which had copied the markup instead, was still carrying its own
        version of the same class of bug: `text-red-600` with NO `dark:`
        variant, so Liabilities rendered #dc2626 on the #1f2937 dark card. That
        is the whole argument for sharing, and it is why the copy is gone.

        The three magnitudes are navy in the shared card because none of them is
        a direction of travel (RULINGS_ON_CAUSE_2026-08-13 §1). The CHANGE below
        them is the exception that proves it: a delta is nothing BUT a direction
        of travel, so it is the one figure on this page that keeps the semantic
        colours — which is also what stops green and red here from being

                     readers see: one line, and nothing else drawn in the plot.
                     A wash of its own colour is safe in exactly that state.

                     It stands down the moment Assets and Liabilities come on,
                     and the ruling above `decompositionSeries` is why. That
                     ruling separates three series by SHAPE in one hue, on the
                     strength of contrast figures measured against the CARD
                     (#f8f9fb / #1f2937). A fill under the total would put the
                     two dashed parts on a different ground than the one those
                     figures describe — the measurement would stop being true
                     without anything failing. With one series there is nothing
                     to separate and no other line's ground to change, so the
                     ruling has no quarrel with it. `richLine.test.tsx` measures
                     this line over its own wash on both grounds. */

                  the Accounts page files under — because "net worth made up
                  of Current Accounts / Investments / Assets…" is the summary
                  a day's flat list buried. "By account" opens each section's
                  accounts beneath its heading; "All" is the old flat list.
                  Sorts follow the Accounts page's idiom — press the active
                  pill again to flip it — and order accounts, never the
                  sections, which keep the ladder's own order. */}
