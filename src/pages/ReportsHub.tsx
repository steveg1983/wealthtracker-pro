 * is open, so the period PERSISTS as the user moves between reports instead
 * of resetting each time. The CONTROL, though, only appears on a report: on
 * the gallery it changed a window nothing on screen was showing, which is
 * how the owner came to report it as doing nothing (25 Aug). A report may
 * also have its own saved window that outranks the shared one — see
 * utils/reportPeriodDefaults. Each report lives at its own /reports/<id> URL and
 * is code-split, so opening the gallery never loads eight reports' worth of
 * charts.
 *
 * Until the user picks a period, each report opens on the window it is worth
 * reading over (net worth over time on ALL of it, not this month). The moment
 * they pick one, that choice wins everywhere and is never overridden.
