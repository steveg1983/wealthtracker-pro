/**
 * Categorisation — the counterpart to Reconciliation.
 *
 * Reconciliation answers "does this account agree with the bank?". This page
 * answers "is every transaction filed?", which is the other thing that has to
 * be true before a report can be trusted. A row with no category is not income
 * and not an expense, so it is excluded from every total in the app; until it
 * is filed it is money the reports cannot see.
 *
 * The three ways out already existed, but only inside the report gallery — you
 * had to already be looking at a report to find them, which is backwards for a
 * chore you do deliberately. They live here now, and the reports' review band
 * still offers the same actions in place.
 *
 * Deliberately reads ALL transactions, not a period: a chore is only finished
 * when nothing is left, and a date filter would hide the work rather than do
 * it.
 *
 * MONEY IN / MONEY OUT CONVERT (Design's §5, 25 Aug). They summed native units
 * as display units and said nothing about it — this page and the Categories
 * data-health panel were the last two such sums in the app, both carried by
 * the currency census at 'native-known' since the 22nd. Offered the choice
 * between mounting the Phase 0 disclosure and converting, Design ruled
 * convert: "disclosure was the honest interim, never the goal." So the figures
 * go through the same flows seam every other aggregation surface uses, and
 * ReportCurrencyNote states the basis — including the degraded case, where the
 * seam declines to convert and the Phase 0 sentence is what says so.

          unfiled row is money the reports cannot see, while a suggested row is
          already counted and merely unverified. Shown even when nothing is
          uncategorised, because "is every category actually mine?" is a
          question in its own right.

          There is no "confirm everything" button, and that is on purpose.
          Confirming without looking would relabel every guess as a decision in
          one click and put us straight back where we started — unable to tell
          what has been checked. A category group is the smallest unit that can
