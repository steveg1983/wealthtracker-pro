 * August: the fold's "3.84%" sat out of line with the shares above it.
 *
 * WHY IT DID. Both kinds of row bleed their hover background outwards with the
 * app's usual `px-2 -mx-2`. A named row is a <Link>, so its width is auto and
 * the box simply grows by the 1rem the negative margins ask for — the padding
 * lands OUTSIDE the column and the text still ends on the column's edge. The
 * fold row is a <button>, and a button cannot be trusted to fill its parent on
 * `display: flex` alone, so it stated `w-full` — which under the border-box
 * every element in this app inherits took that 1rem out of the ROW instead,
 * pulling its right-hand content 16px inwards. Nothing about the percentage
 * itself was wrong; the box around it was a rem narrower.
 *
 * `box-content` is the fix and the reason it is shared: with it, `w-full` means
 * "the column's width, and the hover bleed sits outside it" — the same box the
 * Link works out for itself. Stated once so the two cannot drift apart again,

                  for a filled mark on every point, and a portfolio history runs
                  to hundreds of them, so the marks touched and the line
                  vanished under its own dots. `lineMarkers` is the house answer
                  — bare while you read it, one mark under the pointer — and
                  it keeps `singlePointDot`'s exception for a window holding a
                  single valuation. The wash is the same series colour at

                  The institution line under each name is gone, by the rule
                  that removed it from the Accounts list: when the list is
                  grouped by institution the heading says it, and when it is
                  not, it was a second line of chrome on every row.

                  Each row now accounts for its own total: "Investments" is
                  the total less the paired cash, "Cash" is the paired cash,
                  and the two sum to the figure on the right — a check the
                  reader can do by eye, which is the owner's spec verbatim.

                  The secured liabilities move BELOW the bar under their own
                  small heading, because they are a different kind of fact:
                  the two lines above are parts of the total, and these are
                  not in it at all.

                  Colour is keyed by the line's place in the UNSORTED list, so
                  a dot keeps its colour when the sort changes — the dots and
                  the allocation slices are derived from the same order, and a
                  sort that recoloured every holding would break that thread. */}

                                and the owner caught the cost within the hour:
                                the same loan read (£1,400,000.00) on one page
                                and £1,400,000.00 on this one. Two surfaces
