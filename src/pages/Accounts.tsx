   * first account. P1 charges chrome rent, and four rows of it is more than
   * this page can pay before it has shown a single balance.
   *
   * Search and Sort stay: one finds an account among two hundred, the other
   * decides what the top of the list means, and both are wanted BEFORE
   * looking. Grouping and the two bank-feed actions go behind one switch —
   * grouping is a preference you set once and it persists, and the feeds are
   * an errand rather than a way of reading the list.
   *
   * A DISCLOSURE, NOT A MENU, AND NOT A HOOK.
   * The register's toolbar already solves this exact problem this exact way
   * (a button that reveals the rest of its controls), and the disclosure —
   * `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls` on a button that shows a block — is the
   * most-repeated control idiom in the app. A popover would be a fifth
   * hand-rolled anchored panel with its own focus management, which P7 calls a
   * bug report. And the reveal is a STYLE swap over one DOM, so it is Tailwind
   * classes rather than `useIsMobileViewport`, exactly as `useMediaQuery`'s own
   * doc comment instructs: the hook is for a component swap, and everything
   * else in this app is an `sm:` class.
   *
   * WHICH IS WHY THE DESKTOP CANNOT NOTICE. Every hidden thing is `sm:flex`
   * and the switch itself is `sm:hidden`, so from 640px up the browser
   * computes precisely what it computed before — same elements, same order,
   * same gaps — and this state is not consulted at all.
   *
   * No "active" dot on the switch, though the register has one. Grouping is ON
   * by default (`DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_GROUPING` is byType), so a dot meaning "a
   * control in here is set" would be lit for nearly every user nearly always,
   * and a light that is always on is not a signal. The banded list behind it

   * ─ THE TRAVELLING AMBER, AND THE VIEW IT OPENS ─────────────────────────────
   *
   * With institutions and sections foldable, a page in summary form can hide
   * every account that has work waiting in it: "if I do have everything hidden
   * ... if I have anything to review or to reconcile, it could be very hard to
   * know that unless I periodically opened everything up and scrolled down them
   * all to check."
   *
   * The answer is ONE control that names the next job and carries its count,
   * and a view that shows only the accounts that job belongs to.
   *
   * ─ WHY ONE CONTROL AND NOT TWO ────────────────────────────────────────────
   * Ruling A gives amber to the ONE control you should touch next, so two amber
   * controls side by side would be the erosion it exists to prevent — and the
   * owner's first sketch, an amber column HEADING, would also have made a label
   * into a control. Instead this borrows the reconciliation page's travelling
   * yellow: the colour sits on the step you are on and MOVES as you finish it.
   * Review comes before reconcile because you file what arrived before you
   * agree the balance it lands in, so "next" has an order and the control can
   * simply follow it.
   *
   * A BROKEN FEED OUTRANKS BOTH, which is what keeps the count at exactly one
   * amber on the page: money that is not arriving makes the figures wrong,
   * where unfiled money only makes them untidy. Bank connections keeps the
   * colour while a feed is down and this control waits its turn.

   * demote the account names from headings, which is how a screen-reader user
   * navigates this page. aria-current is the marker the app's other "this is
   * the one you came for" surfaces already use (see useArrivalFocus), and the
   * row itself takes the focus as the selection moves, so the reader announces
   * the row rather than relying on the marker alone.

   *
   * ─ WHY THIS DEPARTS FROM THE DESIGN PASS, DELIBERATELY ─────────────────────
   * DESIGN_PASS_2026-08 §3.3 asked for two things about these buttons, and they
   * are separable. The objection was "twelve outlined boxes on a four-account
   * screen, and the destructive one is as loud as the routine ones" — a wall of
   * chrome in front of the figures the page exists to show. The remedy had two
   * halves: take the BOXES off, and reveal what is left on hover.
   *
   * The boxes are gone and stay gone: borderless glyphs in a neutral grey, the
   * delete no louder than the rest until it is hovered. That is where nearly
   * all of the noise was, and it is the half the owner liked on sight.
   *
   * The hover reveal is the half that came back off (owner's call, 2026-08-13,
   * after living with it). A control nobody can see is a control most people
   * never learn they have: hovering to discover what a row can do is a cost
   * paid on every row by everyone who does not already know, and the
   * touch-screen case had to be special-cased out of it precisely because the
   * interaction does not exist there. Quiet and always present beats loud, but
   * it also beats invisible — and P1's complaint was that the chrome was
   * SHOUTING, not that it existed. Told to the design author as a notice, in
   * the same spirit as the period-pin amendment.
   *
   * If this ever goes back the other way, the thing to keep is what the old
   * implementation got right: never `display: none`. A hidden button is not
   * reachable by Tab, so these were kept in the DOM and in the tab order at
   * zero opacity, and the touch case was gated on `hover: hover` because a
   * phone can never satisfy the reveal.

  // The band heading's glyph went on 15 August, with the rest of the app's

  // ACCOUNTS", above rows that are all current accounts, names the band a
  // second time in a picture. The owner: "everywhere else we have taken them
  // away has looked better."
  //
  // It also cost the alignment. With the glyph gone, a section heading and the
  // institution heading below it now begin at the same x — chevron, name,
  // count — and their totals land in the same column as the account figures,
  // which is what he asked for and what the icon was quietly preventing.

  // ONE renderer for every banded view: a heading that folds the band away,
  // and — when open — either the account cards or, with both switches on, the
  // institution sub-bands holding them. The heading always shows the full
  // band's name, count and total, so a collapsed band still tells you what it
  // is worth.
  //
  // What is IN the band was decided by `displayedList` — the same answer the
  // arrow keys walk, so the two can never differ about which rows exist.

   *     Nothing was converted, so there is nothing to disclose and no reason for
   *     a single-currency ledger to grow a symbol it cannot explain.
   *  2. **A currency in the band has no rate at all** — the FAILURE state. There
   *     is no honest single figure, so the band reports the unsummed pair
   *     ("£X + $Y"). Never the default: it only appears where a rate is
   *     genuinely unresolvable, and the card above it is saying so at the same
   *     moment, out of the same `unconverted` list.
   *  3. **Converted** — the figure, marked `≈`. The mark is the whole
   *     disclosure: WHICH rate and WHEN is stated once per page, by
   *     `ConvertedTotalNote` under the net-worth card, and repeating it per
   *     group would make the scanning aid the widest thing on the row.

                  so the label was set one step under the money — 14px word,
                  16px figure. The owner read the result back: "the words like
                  'Current Accounts' and 'Credit Cards' are now smaller than the
                  figures next to them."

                  He is right, and P1 is not wrong — it is answering a different
                  question. On a card you have already found, the total is what
                  you came for. This is a 130-row list being SCROLLED, and the
                  heading's job there is to tell you where you have got to; a
                  band total nobody navigates by was winning that contest on
                  size alone. So the name goes to `text-card`, level with the
                  figure it introduces, and the institution line below it to
                  `text-body`, keeping the one-step drop BETWEEN the two tiers
                  rather than between a heading and its own number.

                          a band rather than a tinted row.

                          `first:` resets all three: the opening institution in
                          a band sits directly under that band's own heading and

      {/* ONE SCROLLER. This page used to pin the summary and controls and give
          the list a scrolling region of its own, sized
          `lg:h-[calc(100vh-13rem)]` — the viewport minus a HAND-COUNTED 208px
          for the chrome above it.

          That number is a measurement of other people's markup, so it was only
          ever right on the day it was written. Measured 2026-08-13 at 1440×900:
          the chrome above is 168px, not 208 — the region was 40px short of the
          fold before anything changed, and restructuring the control block that
          same day moved it again. Both errors show as the same defect the owner
          reported: the list's own scrollbar ends part-way up the window, the
          page keeps scrolling past it into dead space, and the bottom of the
          list appears to rise as you scroll because the two scrollers are
          consuming the same gesture.

          A phone never had this — the classes were all `lg:`, so the small
          screen has always scrolled as one document, like every other page in
          the app. The desktop now matches it. Nothing here can drift again,
          because there is no longer a number to be wrong.

          If pinned chrome is wanted back, the way to do it is `position:
          sticky` on the chrome itself, which needs no arithmetic about anything
          below it — but 168px of permanently-parked header is rent (P1), and
          that is a design call, not a layout repair. */}

          The gap BEFORE a label has to beat the gap AFTER it, or the eye files
          the label with the group it has just finished reading. "Sort:" used to
          fail that test: its label box was a fixed w-20 while the word is about
          half that, so 50-odd pixels of nothing sat between "Sort:" and its own
          Default button while only 24 separated it from the Institution button
          before it — and it read as Institution's caption.
          The fixed width now applies ONLY below sm, where the two rows stack
          and it is what lines the pill groups up under each other; side by side
          each label is its own width, 8px from its controls and 32 from the
          group before. */}

      {/* THE CHROME PARKS, AND THE LIST SCROLLS UNDER IT.
          ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
          The owner's ask, verbatim: "we fix the information at the top of the
          page to the top of the page, and just scroll the accounts below … as
          when you start to scroll down you loose the ability to see column
          headings and also loose the ability to change the view or refresh
          feeds because you can no longer see anything at the top."

          Note what is and is NOT in this box, because the difference is the
          whole design argument. Parked: the controls, and the column strip.
          Scrolling away as before: the page title, and the net-worth summary
          card. A summary is read once on arrival and then it is rent — the
          same P1 objection that kept this page unpinned until now. Controls
          and column labels are read CONTINUOUSLY while scrolling a 130-row
          list, which is the case for pinning them and the reason the earlier
          ruling allowed sticky on a strip and refused it for the header block.

          THE STRIP RIDES INSIDE THIS BOX rather than under it. That is not
          tidiness — it is what makes the whole thing arithmetic-free. A second
          sticky layer would need to know this one's height, and this one wraps
          from one row to two at narrow widths and grows again when the "More"
          drawer opens, so any `top` written for the strip would be a
          measurement of other people's markup: exactly the mistake that made
          `calc(100vh-13rem)` 40px wrong. One box, one offset, nothing to drift.
          It also lands the strip above the "Current Accounts" heading, which is
          where the owner asked for it.

          The offset is `STICKY_UNDER_APP_BAR`, not a number. The reconciliation
          page's `top-16 md:top-12` was the obvious thing to copy and it is
          wrong three ways, all measured here: it omits the demo banner (36px,
          so the controls park BEHIND the nav in demo mode — seen in a
          screenshot before it was believed), it omits the status-bar inset that
          an installed home-screen app has, and its mobile figure is 64px for a
          header that measures 76. The app bar now publishes its own height the
          way the demo banner already published its own, and the constant adds
          up whatever those three are right now. The negative margins let the
          parked background span the page gutter so rows do not show at its
          edges as they pass beneath.

          `md:sticky` — IT DOES NOT PARK ON A PHONE, and that is a refusal of
          part of the ask rather than an oversight. Built at every width first
          and screenshotted at 390: the block is two rows there, the search box
          on one and the sort pills on the next, and it took 190px of a 760px
          screen while clipping the card beneath it mid-figure. A quarter of the
          phone held permanently by a search field is the "parked header is
          rent" objection at its worst. Nothing is lost by letting it scroll:
          the strip is `hidden sm:flex` so a phone has no column headings to
          lose, and the bottom nav is already the fixed furniture there. The two
          things the owner named — column headings, and reaching the view
          controls and Refresh feeds — are desktop problems, and this is where
          they are solved.

          IT IS A SIBLING OF THE BANDS ON PURPOSE, and this is the one thing
          here that will look like pointless nesting and is not. A sticky box
          travels only within its OWN PARENT: written one level in, sharing a
          wrapper with the summary card, everything above was correct — the
          computed style really said `position: sticky, top: 48px` — and it
          still scrolled away, because that wrapper is 253px tall and ends
          before the first band. Measured at 1280×700: parked top should be 48,
          was 18 at scrollY 400 and −111 at the bottom. Nothing in the CSS was
          wrong; the box was in the wrong box. Keep it a direct sibling of the
          list it heads, or it silently stops sticking again. */}

            group inside to stretch — as content-sized flex items the two
            rows ended at different x and the pills could not line up.

            Group by is two INDEPENDENT switches rather than an either/or pair:
            on their own they band the list one way, together they nest
            institutions inside the type sections, and off they leave one flat
            list. The p-0.5 is not decoration — it matches the height the Sort
            group gets from its own border and padding, so the two rows line up.

            AND THEY HAVE TO LOOK LIKE IT. Both-on is a real state, but wearing
            the same navy fill as Sort's segmented single-choice directly
            beneath, two filled pills read as a broken radio group rather than
            as two things ticked — a phone capture of THIS page is what filed
            it, twice. The control has to say which KIND it is before it can be
            believed about which state it is in, so a pressed toggle carries a
            tick: the one glyph that means "this one too" rather than "this one
            instead". The slot is held open while a switch is off, so ticking
            one does not shove its own label sideways.

            Identical to the reconciliation page's, deliberately — same glyph,
            same size, same held-open slot. Two pages, one idiom; a tick that
            meant something subtly different on each would be worse than no
            tick at all. */}

                A correction is recorded here because the wrong reason was
                written down first: this comment used to claim `rotate-90`
                computes to no rotation in this app, on the strength of a
                console reading of the identity matrix. It does rotate.
                Re-measured 2026-08-13 — `.rotate-90` compiles correctly, the
                base layer initialises all six sibling `--tw-*` variables on
                `*, ::before, ::after`, and with `transition: none` an element
                toggles cleanly between `matrix(0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0)` and `none`.

                The identity matrix was an artefact of WHERE it was measured: an
                automated browser tab reports `document.visibilityState ===
                'hidden'`, and a hidden tab does not advance CSS transitions —
                a 100ms `transition-transform` had not finished after 1991ms,
                and mid-flight it reads as its own start value. Every chevron on
                this page carries `transition-transform`, so all of them look
                frozen there and none of them is.

                Yes — and this is the yellow thread's own case rather than an
                exception to it. Ruling A gives amber to the ONE control you
                should touch next, which is why a COUNT was taken off it: a
                count is not clickable and there can be eight of them. A broken
                feed is the opposite on both counts. There is a single control
                that fixes it, this is that control, and until it is pressed the
                balances on this page are quietly going stale — the page cannot
                say so anywhere else, because a stopped feed looks exactly like
                an account nobody has spent from.

                Colour is not the only carrier: the label changes too, so the
                reason survives for anyone who cannot see the difference, and
                the button says how many rather than merely that something is
                wrong. `reauth_required` counts as broken — see
                `feedsNeedingAttention` — because an expired consent is the
                failure that looks like nothing at all.

                The amber is `accessible-colors.ts`'s warning pair, not a hand
                mixed one: amber-700 on amber-100 measures 5.5:1, amber-300 on
                amber-900 10.7:1. Its neighbour Refresh feeds keeps the quiet
                outline, so there is still exactly one loud control here. */}

          (DESIGN_PASS §4). On a finance app the two look identical and one of
          them is terrifying, so this one names how many accounts are still
          there, what is hiding them, and the control that gives them back.
          Search is the only thing on this page that hides a row: the group and
          sort switches rearrange the list.

          "NOTHING MATCHED" HAS TO MEAN NOTHING MATCHED. The closed band is
          searched now too, so a hit down there is a hit — printing this card
          above it would be the page contradicting itself in the other
          direction, which is how the contradiction was found in the first
          place. Hence the closed-match gate.

          And the count covers both populations, for the reason the count
          exists: it is the promise that Clear filters gives them back, so it
          has to count everything this search is holding — the top-level cards
          in the list and the closed rows in the band beneath it. The figure and
          the remedy describe the same set or neither is worth printing. */}
