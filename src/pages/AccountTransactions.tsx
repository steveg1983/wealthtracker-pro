/**
 * How the register brings a row into view — and the one rule that decides it.
 *
 * ─ THE RULE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WORKING a row centres it. BROWSING does not. The row EDITOR is what tells the
 * two apart: while a row is an editor the user is working, and the row being
 * worked belongs in the middle — wherever the highlight goes next.
 *
 *   What just happened                            Alignment
 *   ────────────────────────────────────────────  ─────────
 *   A ?txn= deep link arrived                     centre
 *   A click made a row the editor                 centre
 *   F2 opened (or re-opened) the editor           centre
 *   Save & Next stepped an editor to the next     centre
 *   Save & Previous stepped it back               centre
 *   Arrow / Page / Home / End / type-ahead,
 *     with a row being EDITED                     centre
 *   …the same keys with nothing being edited      nearest
 *   Shift+arrow stretching a run of rows          nearest — see below
 *   A delete moved the highlight to the next      nearest
 *   A second click opened the full editor         neither — the modal is the view
 *   Escape let go of the row                      neither — nothing is being worked
 *
 * WHY CENTRE FOR THE EDITOR. The owner: "It is nice to see the transactions
 * above and below the one you are working on." A row edited at the foot of the
 * screen shows nothing after it; centred, the row being worked has its
 * neighbours either side, which is how a register is read. Both ends clamp —
 * react-window's 'center' and the non-virtualised path's arithmetic alike stop
 * at the top and at the foot — so the first and last few rows simply sit as
 * near the middle as the list allows, which is the exception he named.
 *
 * An edited row is taller than a plain one and carries its strip of actions
 * with it (see RowDetail), so centring the row centres the whole of it.
 *
 * WHY THE ARROWS FOLLOW THE EDITOR. They did not, and the owner said what that
 * felt like: "When I click on a transaction it does put it in the middle, but
 * when I use the up and down arrows, it is not the list moving up and down and
 * the highlighted box staying in the middle, it is the highlighted box that
 * moves down or up the list." Which is Money's register the wrong way round.
 * Working down a statement, the thing that should hold still is the row being
 * worked; the ledger scrolls beneath it. So an arrow WHILE A ROW IS BEING
 * EDITED moves the editing, and moving it centres it — the same sentence as
 * every other line in the table above.
 *
 * WHY NOT WHEN NOTHING IS BEING EDITED. A bare highlight walking the list is
 * browsing, and re-centring the register on every keystroke would heave the
 * whole page about one line at a time to no end. 'nearest' moves the list only
 * when the highlight reaches an edge, which is what every list that has ever
 * had arrow keys does.
 *
 * WHY SHIFT+ARROW STAYS NEAREST. It is stretching a SELECTION, not moving an
 * editor: no row is an editor at all while more than one is selected (see
 * quickEditRow), so there would be nothing in the middle to keep there, and
 * dragging the register under a growing selection makes it harder to see how
 * far it reaches.

   * ─ AND WHY EVERYTHING CLAIMED IS ALSO STOPPED ─────────────────────────────
   * The app carries a window-level shortcut listener (useKeyboardShortcuts) on
   * which a bare `g` or `n` starts a two-key "go to…" sequence and `?` opens
   * the app-wide list. Without stopPropagation, typing "gr" to find a payee
   * would navigate to Reports mid-word. So `claim` stops the event as well as
   * preventing its default — including for a letter that matched nothing,
   * because a mistyped letter must not take the user off the page either.
