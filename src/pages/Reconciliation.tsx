          bleed the strip across the page gutters so passing rows (and their
          shadows) never peek out at the sides.

          ─ THE OFFSET IS A CONSTANT, NOT TWO NUMBERS ────────────────────────
          This read `top-16 md:top-12` until 2026-08-14, and those literals are
          the bar HEIGHTS with everything above them left out. Measured while
          building the equivalent on the accounts page (#276), all three ways
          they are wrong:

            · the demo banner is not counted, so in demo mode this strip parked
              BEHIND the fixed app nav — the nav is itself pushed down by
              `var(--wt-demo-banner-height)` and this was not;
            · `env(safe-area-inset-top)` is not counted, which is non-zero on an
              installed home-screen app — where the owner actually runs this;
            · and `top-16` is 64px for a mobile header that measures 76, because
              that header is `p-4` around its content rather than a fixed height.

          `STICKY_UNDER_APP_BAR` adds up whatever those three are at the moment
          it is read. Imported from `layout/chromeOffsets`, which is a LEAF
          module — importing the same constant from `Layout` closes a cycle
          (Layout renders the router's Outlet) and throws `ReferenceError` at
          runtime, with lint and strict TypeScript both passing on it. */}
