/**
 * THE PARTS OF A SHARED SURFACE THAT ARE ABOUT THE SERVICE — the contract,
 * named by neither edition.
 *
 * Eight members. Seven of them arrived together, and the neatest fact in this
 * whole phase is where they came from; the eighth arrived on its own and is
 * marked below, because it is the first member that was ADDED to a shared page
 * rather than found already sitting on one.
 *
 * `src/desktop/routes.ts` says a device edition is missing exactly three
 * REGIONS of the product — banking, subscription, auth — each because it needs a
 * server that holds something on your behalf. When the mount slice measured what
 * still stood between the app's pages and a desktop window, after `@session` had
 * taken the state layer's preamble away, what was left was these five, and every
 * one of them is one of those three regions poking through a page that is
 * otherwise entirely about the ledger:
 *
 *     /settings          SubscriptionStatus             subscription
 *     /settings/app      BankFeedRefreshSettings        banking
 *     /settings/security DangerZone                     auth
 *     /accounts          BankingCriticalIncidentBadge   banking
 *     /accounts          useAccountBankSync             banking
 *     /accounts + /settings/data
 *                        BankConnections                banking
 *     /accounts, /dashboard, the register
 *                        useBankConnectionSnapshot      banking
 *     /settings          SignOutPanel                   auth      ← added later
 *
 * The eighth is the one that did not come from the measurement, and the way it
 * arrived is worth keeping: the owner could not find any way to sign out on his
 * phone. The only one was `@chrome`'s `IdentityMenu` — an unlabelled avatar in
 * the header — so the action existed and was unfindable. Giving it a plainly
 * labelled home on `/settings` put a piece of the `auth` region on a page this
 * edition mounts, which is precisely the situation this seam exists for. It
 * belongs to the same region as `DangerZone` and sits one page away from it.
 *
 * That it needed no new type, no new argument and no change to either half's
 * shape is the seam working: a region poking through a shared page is a solved
 * problem here, and the eighth took one line on each side.
 *
 * Not a grab-bag, then, and not "the bits we have not done": one idea, which is
 * **whatever a shared surface says about the account you hold WITH somebody,
 * rather than about the ledger in front of you.** A program whose promise is
 * that the file never leaves the machine has no such account, so it has none of
 * these, and saying that once is better than saying it seven times.
 *
 * ── WHY THE MEMBERS ARE OF TWO KINDS, WHEN `@chrome` REFUSED THAT ───────────
 *
 * `editions/chrome.ts` argues that *"an edition seam whose members are of two
 * different KINDS is one a caller has to remember the shape of"*, and makes
 * `BackgroundWork` a component that renders `null` rather than the hook it
 * really is. Four components and three hooks here is the opposite ruling, and the
 * difference between the two cases is real rather than convenient:
 *
 *   * every `@chrome` member is mounted in ONE tree by ONE file, and being
 *     uniform is what keeps that file readable. Nothing reads a value back out
 *     of any of them;
 *   * `useAccountBankSync` is READ FROM. `pages/Accounts.tsx` destructures six
 *     things out of it and one of them, `connectedCount`, is what decides
 *     whether a "Refresh feeds" button exists at all. Wrapping it in a component
 *     to satisfy a uniformity rule would mean inventing a context to get the
 *     six values back out — machinery whose only purpose is to make a list look
 *     tidy.
 *
 * So the rule this seam keeps instead is the one that actually matters: each
 * member is annotated with a type declared HERE, so both halves are checked
 * against the same shape whichever kind they are.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT A RUNTIME CHECK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `capabilities()` is right there and `{capabilities.backupTarget === 'device'
 * ? null : <SubscriptionStatus/>}` looks like less machinery. It is the mistake
 * `docs/edition-gating.md` opens with: a bundler cannot remove an arm of a
 * branch it cannot evaluate, so the desktop build would carry Clerk, Stripe and
 * the bank-feed client in order to decide at runtime not to draw them. Both
 * bundle greps would fail on the first build. And `dataPort.ts` forbids
 * branching on the descriptor's `edition` field outright, for its own good
 * reasons — the word is COPY, and `editionIsCopyOnly.test.ts` greps the source
 * to keep it that way. (It found this very paragraph, which is the grep being
 * exactly as crude as its own header says it means to be.)
 *
 * ── WHY THE MEMBERS KEEP THEIR NAMES ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `SubscriptionStatus`, not `SubscriptionPanel`. The four pages that use these
 * are shared source and their diff for this slice is one import line each; a
 * rename would have made it four import lines and several JSX edits, for no
 * reader's benefit. The names are the ones somebody grepping the web app will
 * already know.
