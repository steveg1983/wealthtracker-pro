/**
 * `@service`, in a browser: the eight, as they have always been — bar one.
 *
 * The cloud half of the seam `editions/service.ts` declares, and the twin of
 * `desktop/editions/service.ts`. Eight typed re-bindings and nothing else, for
 * `services/port/index.ts`'s reason: the CHOICE is the file, and a choosing file
 * that also does work is a file whose work only one edition gets.
 *
 * `SignOutPanel` is the one that is not "as it has always been": it is new, and
 * it is here rather than on the page because `/settings` is mounted by both
 * editions and only one of them has anybody to sign out. See the component.
 *
 * The annotations are the check. Each `const X: SomeContractType = Y` is the
 * compiler being asked whether the shipped component or hook still answers what
 * the pages are written to give it — which for three of these is nothing, and
 * for the other two is a props object and an options object. A member that grew
 * a required prop would stop compiling here rather than in whichever edition
 * happened to be built next.
