/**
 * The app's state, and the one door it reads and writes through.
 *
 * This file names no engine and, from the mount slice's second half, no EDITION
 * either. Every ledger operation goes through `dataPort` — the seam — and the
 * questions it used to ask about the engine itself (how many writes may be in
 * flight, whether to open a realtime subscription) are answered by that seam's
 * capability descriptor.
 *
 * ── THE FOUR IMPORTS THAT ARE GONE, AND WHAT REPLACED THEM ──────────────────
 *
 * Until the mount slice this provider reached the cloud four ways, all of them
 * inside the seventy lines of ONE effect between *"is Clerk loaded?"* and
 * *"read the ledger"*: `useUser()`, `userIdService`, `AutoSyncService` and
 * `initializeDemoData`. A walk from here with a desktop's resolution found 48
 * modules and those four roots, and nothing else in these 2,200 lines reached a
 * cloud at all — which is why twenty of the twenty-five owed desktop routes
 * named this one file as their only blocker.
 *
 * They are behind `@session` now: a specifier the BUILD resolves, exactly as it
 * resolves `@data`. The hook answers three things — is the session settled, is
 * there an owner, and *"do whatever your edition must do before I read"* — and
 * a browser's answer is the hundred lines that used to be here while a device's
 * is that it happened when the file was opened. Nothing was deleted; the same
 * code runs in the same order in the web build, from `editions/cloud/session.ts`.
 *
 * THE NAME OF THIS FILE IS NOW WRONG, and knowingly so. It says Supabase and it
 * has not mentioned Supabase since the seam landed. Renaming it would touch
 * roughly seventy importers for no behaviour, and the module path is what those
 * importers are written against; it is a rename to do on a quiet day, not while
 * an edition is being mounted on top of it.
