/**
 * The BACKUP FILE FORMAT — what a file IS, and every rule about reading one.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A MODULE OF ITS OWN, AND WHAT WAS LEFT BEHIND ───────────────
 *
 * `backupService.ts` does two different jobs. One is the cloud's: read fourteen
 * tables over PostgREST, hand the file to the browser to download, pour a file
 * back in through the restore RPCs. Its first line is `import { supabase }`, and
 * that is right for the half of it that talks to a database.
 *
 * The other job is not about any engine at all. The tag a file carries, which
 * tables it holds and in what order, how a bundle is built out of rows, what
 * makes a file valid, which columns hold references, how every id in one is
 * remapped, and the order a restore must apply the steps in — those are
 * statements about a FILE ON SOMEBODY'S DISK. `dataPort.ts` says so where it
 * imports these types: *"these types describe a file on the user's disk, not an
 * engine … a local edition inherits the format for the same reason it inherits
 * the seam."*
 *
 * That half is here now, so a caller can have the format without a Supabase
 * client. Nothing in this file imports one, and nothing in it can: the two
 * things it needs from elsewhere are `PREFERENCE_KEYS_HOLDING_IDS` and
 * `parsePreferencesDocument`, which slice 27 lifted into
 * `services/preferences/document.ts` for exactly this reason.
 *
 * ── THE OBLIGATION THIS DISCHARGES ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `localDataPort.ts`'s `BackupFormat` records it in full: the local port may not
 * import `backupService.ts`, so the format arrives injected, and *"whoever opens
 * a document in the DESKTOP shell (slice 27) must supply an implementation that
 * does not itself reach a Supabase client. Today that means lifting the pure
 * format half out of `backupService.ts` into a module of its own, which is a
 * FILE MOVE — and a file move is a `scripts/port-coverage` manifest change, so
 * it belongs to the commit that has a desktop bundle to measure."* This is that
 * commit and this is that module.
 *
 * ── IT IS A MOVE, NOT A FORK ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every function below is the one the cloud export and the browser export have
 * always called, moved verbatim. `backupService.ts` re-exports all of it, so no
 * caller changed and no second builder of one format exists — which is the whole
 * point, because the format is the only thing making a backup portable between
 * editions (B-11).

 *
 * It is stamped into the file so a restore can be told which schema the rows
 * were shaped by. Bump it when a migration changes what a backed-up row looks
 * like, not on every migration: its job is to date the ROW SHAPE, and a file

   * `custom_reports.filters` holds `accounts` and `categories` — both arrays of
   * row ids, in a column that is not called `metadata` — and the honest choices
   * were to generalise this field or to grow a second one beside it. A second

   * mechanisms doing one job means the next id-carrying blob is added to
   * whichever of the two its author happens to read, and the one that is missed
   * fails SILENTLY, because nothing constrains a key inside a jsonb value on
   * either engine. There is one mechanism, so there is one place to add to.
   *
   * ── AND STILL BY KEY, NEVER BY SWEEPING THE COLUMN ────────────────────────
   *
   * The rule the old field stated survives the generalisation unchanged, and it
   * is the important half. `metadata` also carries a user's own free text, and
   * `filters` carries `tags` — labels somebody typed, which are deliberately NOT
   * here. Rewriting anything inside one of these columns that happened to match
   * an id in the file would corrupt it, and a person whose tag is a uuid-shaped
   * string is a person nobody is going to think about again.
