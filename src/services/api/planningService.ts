/**
 * Planning data persistence: budgets, goals, categories, custom reports — THE
 * CLOUD HALF, and only the cloud half.
 *
 * Until 2026-06 these entities lived ONLY in React state — every budget and
 * goal was lost on page refresh, and nothing reached the cloud tables that
 * have existed since the initial schema.
 *
 * Budgets and goals: Supabase, per-user and RLS-scoped.
 *
 * Categories: cloud-synced via the migrate_categories_atomic RPC. The default
 * category set uses non-UUID ids ('type-income', 'transfer-in', …) which the
 * uuid-keyed cloud table cannot store, AND transactions/budgets reference
 * categories by those text ids — so on a user's first cloud load the RPC
 * generates per-user uuids and remaps every reference in ONE database
 * transaction (orphaning is structurally impossible).
 *
 * EVERY OPERATION HERE REQUIRES THE CLOUD CONNECTION AND A RESOLVED OWNER.
 * Until 2026-08 each one carried a second half that wrote encrypted
 * localStorage whenever Supabase was unconfigured OR the caller passed a null
 * user id. That half is gone, and removing it changed no behaviour, because it
 * could not run:
 *
 *  - The only production importer of this class is `dataService.ts` (`grep -rn
 *    PlanningService src api scripts` — every other match is
 *    `taxPlanningService`, an unrelated file, or a test).
 *  - Every one of its call sites there sits inside a branch guarded by
 *    `userId && this.supabaseChecker()`, where `userId` is resolved on the same
 *    tick from `userIdService.getCurrentDatabaseUserId()` and `supabaseChecker`
 *    is `isSupabaseConfigured`. So a call that arrives here has a non-null owner
 *    and a configured client, and one that has neither never leaves DataService.
 *  - `cloudReady` below is `isSupabaseConfigured() && supabase !== null`, and
 *    supabaseClient defines `isSupabaseConfigured()` as exactly
 *    `supabase !== null`. The caller's guard and this class's guard are the same
 *    question, asked twice.
 *
 * So `cloudReady && userId` was always true when any of this ran, and the local
 * branches were dead code holding a live hazard: a null owner did not fail and
 * did not warn — it wrote the browser's copy, showed the user a saved budget,
 * and lost it at the next boot when the cloud read beside it answered instead.
 * Everything that is not a signed-in cloud session now goes through DataService,
 * which owns the browser-storage engine and refuses a write while a session is
 * still connecting. What is left here refuses by name.
 *
 * `getCategories` / `saveCategories` are NOT part of that retired half. They are
 * the cloud branches' own offline cache — refreshed after every category row
 * lands — and they are what a signed-in person's offline boot reads its category
 * names from.
