/**
 * What a person asked their phone to tell them — the preference, as a shape
 * both sides can read.
 *
 * Pure on purpose, with no imports: the SERVER decides whether to send a push
 * (api/_lib/cloud-refresh-announce.ts, api/cron/reminders.ts) by reading the
 * same preferences document the browser writes, and a module that reached the
 * preferences service would drag a Supabase client into the serverless graph.
 * The browser's storage half is utils/phoneNotifications.ts; this is the file
 * format, the same split services/preferences/document.ts makes.
 *
 * Three switches, each an answer to "what would you want your phone to
 * interrupt you for?":
 *
 *   feedActivity      new transactions arrived from a bank feed the SERVER
 *                     refreshed (so it needs Bank feed refresh = In the cloud;
 *                     a browser sync shows its own toast and needs no push)
 *   feedAttention     a feed has stopped and needs reconnecting — the quiet
 *                     failure, the one where nothing looks broken and the
 *                     balances simply go stale (useAccountBankSync's header)
 *   balanceReminders  the balance-update reminder the person scheduled in
 *                     Settings, delivered to the lock screen rather than
 *                     waiting for the app to be opened
 *
 * All off by default: a notification nobody asked for is not a feature.
