/**
 * Preferences that travel with the ACCOUNT rather than with the browser.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A full backup was restored into a fresh login and the app came up
 * factory-reset: right accounts, right transactions, and every choice the owner
 * had ever made about how to LOOK at them gone. Which accounts the dashboard
 * pins, which reports are pinned beside them, the period each surface opens on,
 * how the Accounts page is banded and sorted, which register columns are
 * hidden, the archive cutoffs he had set per account — a whole tier of
 * personalisation lived in `window.localStorage` and nowhere else. It did not
 * back up, it did not follow him to a second machine, and nothing said so.
 *
 * The fix is not "back up localStorage". localStorage holds two different kinds
 * of thing side by side: statements about the USER ("show me twelve months",
 * "these six accounts matter") and statements about the DEVICE ("this browser
 * has shown you the import tip", "this screen fits a 240px description
 * column"). Carrying the second kind across machines makes the app worse, not
 * better. So each key is classified once, and only the first kind lives here.
 *
 * ── THE DOCUMENT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One row per user holding ONE jsonb document, not a row per key. Preferences
 * are read as a SET exactly once (at boot, before the first paint that depends
 * on them), written rarely, and have to travel whole into a backup file. A row
 * per key would turn one round trip into fifty, and would let a restore land
 * half a user's settings.
 *
 * Values are stored as the SAME STRINGS localStorage held — not as a typed
 * object graph. That is deliberate:
 *
 *   * every call site already serialises to a string, so rewiring one is
 *     `localStorage.` → `preferences.` and nothing else. The point of this work
 *     is where the data LIVES, not renaming it;
 *   * a key this build has never heard of is preserved untouched. An older
 *     client cannot drop a newer client's preference, because it never parses
 *     it — which is the property that makes a shared document safe to roll out
 *     to two versions at once;
 *   * a corrupt value costs exactly one preference. Each call site already
 *     guards its own parse (they had to: localStorage is hand-editable), so a
 *     bad value falls back to that key's default instead of failing the load.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Anything that grows with the size of the dataset. Everything registered below
 * is a toggle, an enum, a short list of account ids, or a handful of column
 * names. The database backs this up with a hard CHECK on the document's size
 * (see migration 20260809160000): preferences are small, and a table that lets
 * them stop being small would become a second, unindexed copy of the ledger.

 * because `PreferencesProvider` sits ABOVE `AppProvider` in the tree — the
 * database identity it needs does not exist when it mounts. The service is
 * bound to a user when that identity resolves (see AppContextSupabase), and
 * everything below re-renders through `subscribe`.
