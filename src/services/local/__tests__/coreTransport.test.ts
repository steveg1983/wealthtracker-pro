/**
 * The envelope, and what the port does with each half of it.
 *
 * The contract suite proves the local edition against a REAL ledger file, which
 * is the right way to prove behaviour and the wrong way to prove this: the read
 * verbs have no refusal in them (an owner with no accounts has an empty list,
 * which is an answer), so the whole `ok:false` half of the wire would go
 * untested there and only be reached the first time a write refused in front of
 * a person.
 *
 * So this file drives the port over a transport of its own — no processes, no
 * files, no Rust — and asks the two questions the wire actually decides:
 *
 *   WHAT A REFUSAL COSTS. The crate wrote a sentence for a person to read. Seam
 *   rule 4 says `.message` is rendered straight into the UI, so it must arrive
 *   verbatim: not prefixed, not wrapped, not re-worded. A transport that
 *   "helpfully" said "Request failed: …" would put its own words in front of
 *   somebody in the ~28 places the app prints an error.
 *
 *   WHAT A FAULT COSTS. A file that will not open is not an answer, and the
 *   three reads the seam says may never reject have to absorb it — because the
 *   boot has ONE outer catch and reaching it replaces the whole app with
 *   "Failed to load data" for somebody whose next launch would have worked.
 *
 * It runs in the ordinary suite, unlike the contract run: there is no ledger
 * crate in it, so there is nothing here a machine without a Rust toolchain
 * cannot answer.
