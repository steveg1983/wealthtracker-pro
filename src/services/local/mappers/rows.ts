/**
 * A crate answer's rows as the app's own objects.
 *
 * Eight translations, one per entity the seam reads, and each one is the ONLY
 * place that entity crosses from the file into the application. They are here
 * rather than beside the port for the reason `accountMapping.ts` gives at
 * length about the two account mappers that once existed: *"an account has ONE
 * shape however it was loaded"*, and two mappers each complete in the fields the
 * other forgot made three bugs no amount of reading either file would explain.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS REUSED, AND WHAT COULD NOT BE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ACCOUNTS reuse the cloud's mapper outright. `services/api/accountMapping.ts`
 * is "the ONE translation" and it imports nothing but types, so the local
 * edition can call it without dragging a Supabase client into a desktop bundle.
 * One rename happens first (see {@link toAccount}) and then the same function
 * the cloud boot uses reads the row. Anything it learns, this learns.
 *
 * The other six have a cloud twin that CANNOT be imported: `budgetFromDb` /
 * `goalFromDb` live inside `planningService.ts`, the split mapper inside
 * `transactionService.ts`, and both modules carry a Supabase client at module
 * scope. Importing either would put the cloud in the desktop bundle — the exact
 * thing PHASE3-PLAN §5's two bundle greps exist to refuse. So the mappings
 * below are written out, each naming the twin it must agree with and copying
 * its decisions explicitly rather than by accident:
 *
 *   budgets      planningService.ts `budgetFromDb`  — categoryId travels in the
 *                TEXT `category` column, never in the uuid `category_id`
 *   goals        planningService.ts `goalFromDb`    — `type` lives in metadata,
 *                `isActive` is "not paused", `progress` IS `current_amount`
 *   splits       transactionService.ts `mapSplitRow`
 *   transactions transactionService.ts `mapFromDbFields` + `DB_TO_CAMEL`
 *   categories   planningService.ts's category select
 *   dismissals   suggestionDismissalService.ts
 *
 * Making those six shareable means lifting them out of two Supabase-carrying
 * modules, which is a refactor of the cloud path and belongs to a commit that
 * says so. Until then the guard against drift is not this comment: it is the
 * contract suite, which asks both engines the same questions and compares
 * app-shaped answers.
 *
 * CUSTOM REPORTS ARE THE EXCEPTION, and they were written the other way round
 * from the start. Their two JSON columns are the only values in this app stored
 * as free-form JSON and read back as a CLOSED type, so nothing in either store
 * constrains what is inside them and a round-trip test cannot see a reader that
 * is wrong in the same way at both ends. Two readers would draw two different
 * reports from one definition. So the reading lives in
 * `services/reports/document.ts` — a module of two type imports, safe in a
 * desktop bundle for the reason `preferences/document.ts` is — and both engines
 * call it. See {@link toCustomReport}.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE FILE CANNOT ANSWER, STATED RATHER THAN GUESSED ────────────────
 *
 * This paragraph named three fields and is down to one. `Transaction.reconciled`
 * and `Account.lastReconciledBalance` had no column in
 * `scripts/local-sqlite/schema.sql` — the mirror predated
 * `20260810200000_marking_is_not_reconciling.sql` — and both are ported now
 * (the account's in slice 20, the transaction's with the reconciliation verbs).
 * What is left is `Transaction.metadata`-derived fields, which read as
 * `undefined` because the blob is not projected by any read here.
 *
 * The rule the ported column brought with it stands, and it is why `reconciled`
 * is mapped through `answeredFlag` rather than through `flag`: the column is
 * NULLABLE, and a NULL means "ask `cleared`"
 * (`utils/transactionReconciliation.ts`), which is the one-flag behaviour a row
 * written before the split is still describing. Inventing `false` for one would
 * report a whole reconciled history as unreconciled work.
