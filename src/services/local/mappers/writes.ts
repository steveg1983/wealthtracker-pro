/**
 * The app's shapes on their way INTO a ledger file.
 *
 * The other half of `rows.ts`, and deliberately not its mirror image. Reading is
 * one question — the crate answers with a whole row and the app wants a whole
 * object — while writing is many: `create_transaction` takes a draft,
 * `update_transaction` takes a patch of sixteen fields, an import row takes
 * thirteen keys, and a split line takes five. Each of those is a SUBSET of the
 * same columns, and each refuses a key it has not heard of
 * (`deny_unknown_fields`), so the subsets are written out below rather than
 * inferred.
 *
 * What is NOT written out again is the correspondence itself. Every function
 * here goes through `columns.ts` — the same table `rows.ts` reads — so a field
 * cannot be written under one name and read back under another, and cannot be
 * a decimal string going out and a number coming in. That is the property
 * `localCore.fixtureFile.ts` already insists on for its own two directions, and
 * the reason it gives applies with more force here: two conversions that are
 * each wrong in the same way agree perfectly.
 *
 * ── THE TWO SHAPES OF "A KEY THE VERB HAS NOT HEARD OF" ─────────────────────
 *
 * This file makes opposite decisions for the create path and the update path,
 * and the difference is the whole of divergence D-7.
 *
 * A CREATE is FILTERED. `create_transaction_atomic` reads the keys it knows out
 * of a jsonb blob and ignores the rest, and the app's callers rely on it: the
 * seam hands over `Omit<Transaction, 'id'>`, which carries `isSplit`,
 * `archived`, `linkedTransferId` and half a dozen other fields the create verb
 * has no argument for. Sending them would make every ordinary create a refusal.
 * So the create builder sends the verb's own list and nothing else, which
 * reproduces the cloud's discard rather than inventing a stricter engine.
 *
 * An UPDATE is PASSED THROUGH WHOLE. The cloud discards an unrecognised key in
 * SILENCE, and that silence has an incident behind it — the reconciliation
 * page's cleared checkbox "succeeded" for a month without touching `is_cleared`,
 * so a difference could never reach zero. The local core refuses instead, by
 * name, which is D-7's declared row for this engine. It can only refuse what it
 * is shown, so the update builder must NOT quietly drop a field it does not
 * recognise: `archived` goes over the wire and comes back as a refusal naming
 * it, which is exactly what the contract suite asks this engine for.
 *
 * THE ACCOUNT PAIR TAKES THE SAME TWO SHAPES, and for once the update's half is
 * not a divergence at all: `mapAccountToDb` sends a field it has no column for
 * under its own name, and PostgREST then refuses the whole update because there
 * is no such column. So both engines refuse an unrecognised account field, and
 * the local `deny_unknown_fields` is parity rather than strictness. What the
 * account update DOES drop is listed and argued at
 * {@link ACCOUNT_UPDATE_DROPS} — two of them are the cloud's own drop-list and
 * three are timestamps a caller has no business stating.
 *
 * THE CATEGORY PAIR IS FILTERED ON BOTH SIDES, which is neither of the two
 * shapes above and is the third thing a cloud mapper can be. `categoryToDb` is a
 * WHITELIST — eleven `if (c.k !== undefined)` lines and no else — so a key it
 * has no line for never reaches the cloud's table at all. Passing one through
 * would make the local edition refuse an edit the cloud performs, and the field
 * it would refuse on is a real one: `Category.description` exists in the app's
 * type and has a column in neither engine.
 *
 * THE BUDGET AND GOAL PAIRS ARE FILTERED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS TOO, for the same
 * reason and against the same kind of mapper: `budgetToDb` is twelve
 * `if (b.k !== undefined)` lines and `goalToDb` is a similar list, so both are
 * whitelists and a key neither has a line for never reaches the cloud's table.
 *
 * So the rule is not "creates filter and updates do not". It is: **do what the
 * cloud's own mapper does with a key it has never heard of.** For a transaction
 * that is discard-on-create and send-on-update; for an account it is send in
 * both directions; for a category, a budget and a goal it is discard in both.
 *
 * ── AND THE PART A COLUMN TABLE CANNOT DO: MANY FIELDS, ONE COLUMN ───────────
 *
 * Three of this file's builders fold SEVERAL app fields into ONE column, which
 * `columns.ts` deliberately cannot express — it is one row per column, and a
 * correspondence with two left-hand sides is not a correspondence:
 *
 *   an account's `openingBalance || balance || 0` → `initial_balance`
 *   a goal's `progress ?? currentAmount`          → `current_amount`
 *   a goal's `status ?? achieved ?? isActive`     → `status`
 *
 * Every one of them is a line of the cloud's own writer, transcribed with its
 * own operator: `||` where the writer wrote `||`, `??` where it wrote `??`. The
 * difference is reachable in both cases — `??` passes an empty string and a zero
 * through and `||` does not — so the operators are copied rather than chosen.

 * `Omit<CustomReport, 'id'>` and the crate mints one (B-5). The verb accepts an
 * id anyway, so that the differential harness can name a row on both engines.
 *
 * FILTERED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, which is the third of the three shapes this
 * file's header lays out and the same one a category, a budget and a goal have:
 * the cloud mapper it ports is a whitelist — five `if (r.k !== undefined)` lines
 * and no else — so a key it has no line for never reaches the cloud's table, and
 * a port that sent one would refuse an edit the cloud performs.
 * `Partial<CustomReport>` carries exactly such keys: `createdAt` and `updatedAt`
 * are on every report object the builder hands back, and neither is an
 * instruction on an UPDATE.

 * A new report as `create_custom_report`'s payload.
 *
 * ── THE TWO TIMESTAMPS ARE DROPPED, AND THAT COSTS SOMETHING ────────────────
 *
 * `Omit<CustomReport, 'id'>` carries `createdAt` and `updatedAt` — the builder
 * puts them on every report it hands back — and neither reaches the store. Both
 * engines stamp their own: `create_custom_report`'s draft has five fields and
 * none of them is a clock, and `customReportToDb` is a whitelist with no line
 * for either column. That is the same treatment a new BUDGET's two timestamps
 * get, and the rule `columns.ts` states for every create in this file — a
 * caller's copy of a timestamp is what it last read, not an instruction.
 *
 * What it costs is worth writing down rather than discovering. The ADOPTION
 * (`customReportService.adoptLegacyReports`) carries reports out of a browser's
 * old storage key, and some of those were built years ago; they arrive in the
 * store dated the day the adoption ran, so the reports page will say somebody
 * created them this morning. The alternative was worse in a way that is not
 * obvious: the cloud's INSERT could honour a stated `created_at` and the file's
 * verb cannot, so honouring it on one side would be an UNDECLARED divergence
 * between the editions — two engines disagreeing about when a person did
 * something, which is exactly the class of difference the contract suite exists
 * to make impossible.

 * A partial edit as `update_custom_report`'s patch.
 *
 * ── THE TWO JSON COLUMNS REPLACE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF THIS FUNCTION ────
 *
 * `toGoalUpdatePatch` above sends a `metadata` object the VERB then merges over
 * what is stored, because three unrelated app fields share that one column and
 * rebuilding it from a partial update once deleted a goal's linked accounts.
 * Nothing shares these two columns, so the verb REPLACES them — and the
 * difference has to be got right in this direction rather than left to the
 * engine, because a merged `components` array would make removing a component
 * impossible: the removed one would survive every save and no screen would
 * explain why it kept coming back.
 *
 * A field the caller did not state is absent from the patch and the verb leaves
 * the column alone, which is how "rename this report" avoids rewriting its
 * components at all. `payloadOf` drops only `undefined`, so a stated `null` (a
 * value neither of these columns should ever hold) still travels and the crate's
 * own boundary is what judges it.
 *
 * `updatedAt` is not sent, exactly as it is not sent on the create above. An
 * edit happens now, by definition, so the store's clock is the honest answer and
 * a caller's copy of the old value would freeze the timestamp at whatever it
 * last read.
