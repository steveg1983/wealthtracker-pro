/**
 * The columns, declared ONCE and read in both directions.
 *
 * ── WHY A TABLE AND NOT TWO FUNCTIONS ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Until this slice the mappers only went one way: a crate answer became an app
 * object and nothing ever went back. A second direction is where a translation
 * layer earns its worst bug, and the bug has a shape — one side learns a
 * column, or renames one, or converts it a shade differently, and the other
 * does not. The value then crosses out under one name and back under another,
 * and the only evidence is a field that quietly stops changing.
 *
 * `localCore.fixtureFile.ts` had already met this and answered it, in its own
 * words: *"two independent CONVERSIONS would not be [worth having]. If the
 * writer decided that £70.10 is 7010 and the reader decided it is 7010 by its
 * own route, a shared mistake in the two routes would still cancel out and a
 * real disagreement between them would look like a fixture bug."* So it
 * declared its columns once and made the writer and the reader two
 * interpretations of that list. This file is the same discipline on the port's
 * side of the boundary, and it is the reason a field cannot round-trip
 * differently from the way it crosses: there is one row per column, carrying
 * the wire key, the app field and the kind, and BOTH directions read it.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT shared is ASSEMBLY — which fields a verb sends,
 * which are required, what a missing value defaults to. Those genuinely differ
 * per direction and per verb (`create_transaction` takes a whole draft,
 * `update_transaction` takes a patch, an import row takes thirteen keys), and
 * pretending otherwise would make the table a place to hide a decision.
 * `rows.ts` holds the read assembly, `writes.ts` the write assembly, and this
 * file holds nothing but the correspondence.
 *
 * ── ONLY THE ENTITIES THAT REALLY GO BOTH WAYS ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Transactions, split lines, accounts, categories, budgets, goals — and, since
 * slice 23, dismissals, which were the last entity still read-only and were
 * written out in `rows.ts` for exactly as long as a one-directional mapping had
 * nothing to disagree with. Each entity joins this table in the commit that
 * gives it a writer, and the promise has now been kept four times running:
 * `toCategory`, `toBudget`, `toGoal` and `toDismissal` each moved out of
 * hand-written property access and into `fieldsOf` in the same commit as their
 * own write payload. The list was declared COMPLETE at slice 23 — every entity
 * the seam carried went both ways — with the note that *"the next entity to
 * join is a new one rather than a postponed one"*.
 *
 * CUSTOM REPORTS ARE THAT ENTITY, and they kept the shape of the promise: they
 * arrive in this table with `toCustomReport` and their two write payloads in one
 * commit, having never had a one-directional mapping to drift from.
 *
 * ── WHAT A ROW HERE CANNOT SAY, AND WHERE THAT LIVES INSTEAD ────────────────
 *
 * One column, one field. That is the whole shape of the table, and two of this
 * slice's mappings do not fit it:
 *
 *   `Goal.progress` and `Goal.currentAmount` are ONE column, and `goalToDb`
 *   gives `progress` precedence over `currentAmount`;
 *   `Goal.isActive` and `Goal.achieved` are both derived from `status`, and the
 *   write direction has to fold three app fields back into one.
 *
 * Neither is a correspondence, so neither is here: they are ASSEMBLY, and
 * `writes.ts` owns them beside the account create's `openingBalance || balance
 * || 0`, which folds two app fields into one column for exactly the same reason.
 * The read direction's half lives in `rows.ts`. What this table holds for a goal
 * is the fifteen columns whose name and conversion really are one thing in both
 * directions.
 *
 * ACCOUNTS ARE THE ONE ENTRY HERE WHOSE READ DOES NOT COME BACK THROUGH IT, and
 * that is a stronger arrangement rather than a hole in the rule. `rows.ts`'s
 * `toAccount` is `mapAccountFromDb` — *the* cloud translation, the one that
 * exists because there used to be two of them — so the read direction is not
 * "another interpretation of this table", it is literally the same function the
 * signed-in boot uses. What this table owns for an account is therefore the
 * WRITE: the wire key, and the conversion. Its correspondence is checked against
 * `accountMapping.ts`'s own `ACCOUNT_FIELD_TO_COLUMN`, which is the map the read
 * side is built from, and any disagreement shows up immediately as a field that
 * goes out under one name and comes back missing.
 *
 * ── MONEY CROSSES AS THE NUMBER'S OWN DECIMAL TEXT ──────────────────────────
 *
 * On the way out, `amount` becomes `String(amount)` — NOT `toFixed(2)`, and
 * emphatically not `amount * 100`. Both of those look tidier and both destroy
 * the property M-1 exists for.
 *
 * `toFixed(2)` ROUNDS. The seam declares that the local core REFUSES an amount
 * below a penny (`SUB_PENNY_AMOUNT`), and the crate does refuse one — but only
 * if it is ever shown one. A port that rounded −0.125 to "-0.13" on the way in
 * would turn a refusal into a silent invention of half a penny, and the engine
 * would look like the cloud while behaving like neither.
 *
 * `* 100` is worse and is banned outright under this directory: it is float
 * arithmetic on money (30.6 * 100 is 3059.9999999999995), and the rounding that
 * hides it is the thing being hidden. There is no `* 100` and no `/ 100` here
 * to find — the same greppable rule `values.ts` states for the other direction.
 *
 * So the number's own decimal spelling goes over the wire and the crate judges
 * it: "0.2", "-70.1", "0" and "30.6" are all accepted and stored to the penny,
 * and "0.30000000000000004" — which is what a float sum of 0.1 and 0.2 actually
 * is — is refused by name. That is the correct answer to a figure the app
 * should never have arrived at.

  | 'accountType'
  /**
   * A fixed-point figure the APP keeps as a `Decimal` rather than as a number —
   * a holding's `quantity` and the two unit prices beside it.
   *
   * The one kind here whose app-side type is not a JavaScript primitive, and it
   * is the app's own choice rather than this table's: `InvestmentHolding` says
   * `DecimalInstance` because eight decimal places of a fund unit, and a share
   * price of £32.775, do not survive being a `number` through arithmetic. The
   * seam repeats it (`DataPortInvestmentWrites` argues it at length) and this
   * kind carries it across the wire.
   *
   * WRITTEN WITH `toFixed()`, NOT `toString()`, and the difference is a real
   * refusal rather than a preference. `Decimal.toString()` switches to
   * exponential notation below 1e-7, so a holding of `0.00000001` units — which
   * is inside the eight places the schema chose, and is real for crypto —
   * crosses as `"1e-8"`. Postgres accepts that; the crate's grammar refuses an
   * exponent by name, and a caller would see a malformed-figure error for a
   * figure that is not malformed. `toFixed()` never uses exponential notation.
   *
   * NOT `money`. That kind writes `String(amount)` and reads through
   * `values.money`, which produces a `number` — the one conversion the seam
   * allows for an AMOUNT (rule 2). Sending a quantity through it would put a
   * float on the path this kind exists to keep off it.
   *
   * READ-ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION, like the account rows: a holding comes back
   * through `services/investments/holding.ts`'s `toHolding`, which is the CLOUD's
   * own mapper and is therefore literally the same function the signed-in page
   * uses. So what this table owns for a holding is the WRITE.

  | 'exact'
  /**
   * A whole JSON VALUE — a custom report's `components` array and its `filters`
   * object, and so far only those two.
   *
   * The one kind here that crosses UNCONVERTED in both directions, and that is
   * the conversion rather than the absence of one. Everything else in this table
   * is a scalar the two engines spell differently (pennies against a decimal
   * string, a Date against a day, 0/1 against a boolean), so a kind's job is to
   * pick the spelling. A jsonb column and a SQLite TEXT column holding JSON both
   * arrive here as the value the crate has already parsed, so the correct
   * conversion is none at all.
   *
   * WHAT IT MUST NOT DO IS `JSON.stringify`. The wire is JSON: a stringify on
   * the way out would send a STRING where the verb expects an array, and the
   * store would then hold a JSON document containing JSON — which reads back as
   * "not an array" and answers with an empty report, silently, because nothing
   * constrains the inside of a JSON column on either engine.
   *
   * The value is not INSPECTED here either. Deciding what a stored component
   * means is `services/reports/document.ts`'s job, shared with the cloud mapper
   * precisely so that the two engines cannot draw different reports from one

 * A dismissal, column by column — the five the cloud's own read names, and

 *
 * `suggestionDismissalService.list` does not `select('*')`: it names
 * `id, kind, subject_key, subject_ids, dismissed_at`, its `toDismissal` reads
 * exactly those, and `dismiss`'s `.select()` names the same five again. So the
 * two directions really are one list here, which is the cleanest case this table
 * has: nothing is assembled, nothing is folded, and there is no column with no
 * field or field with no column.
 *
 * `subject_ids` IS in the table even though the two engines keep it in different
 * shapes — `uuid[]` on the row in the cloud, the child table
 * `suggestion_dismissal_subjects` in a file. That difference is the CRATE's to
 * hide and it does hide it: the verb writes the array at its own positions into
 * `role_order` and the read joins it back, so what crosses this boundary is an
 * array in role order either way. A port that had to know about a child table
 * would be a port that knows about SQLite.
 *
 * `dismissed_at` is `instant` in both directions, and unlike `Goal.completedAt`
 * it really is a Date on the app's side (`SuggestionDismissal.dismissedAt`), so
 * no string passes through untouched here.
 *
 * `kind` is plain `text`. The seven values are enumerated by a CHECK in both
 * engines and this table holds no second copy of them — `rows.ts` narrows the
 * string to the app's union on the way in, which is the only place a list of
 * them is needed and the only place one appears.
