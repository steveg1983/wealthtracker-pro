/**
 * "What the bank said this account holds" — or an explicit statement that it
 * said nothing.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS TYPE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every balance path in the banking API used to start at `let balance = 0` and
 * fill it in from TrueLayer inside a try/catch. A momentary failure of the
 * balance endpoint therefore produced the number 0 — indistinguishable, one
 * line later, from a bank that genuinely reported an empty account. That zero
 * was then written as if it were fact:
 *
 *   • account CREATION seeded `balance`, `bank_balance` AND `initial_balance`
 *     from it, so a new account asserted it held £0.00 on the day it was
 *     linked, and the first-import rebase (initial_balance -= Σ backfill, see
 *     migration 20260613090000) built its arithmetic on a figure that was
 *     never true;
 *   • the sync UPDATE path stamped `bank_balance_date` = today onto it, dating
 *     a fabrication as this morning's reading;
 *   • the link modal showed it to the user as their balance and prefilled it
 *     into the new-account form.
 *
 * A `number` cannot carry "the bank did not answer", so the type has to. Every
 * producer of a bank figure returns one of these, and every consumer is forced
 * by the compiler to decide what to do when there is no figure. The invariant
 * the whole module exists to hold:
 *
 *   NEVER write a fabricated figure as if the bank had reported it.
 *
 * No arithmetic happens here — a snapshot carries the bank's own number
 * through unchanged. The one conversion (a card's amount-owed → the app's
 * negative liability) is delegated to cardBalanceToAppBalance, which does it
 * in Decimal.
