/**
 * A real `.db` file, seeded from an APP-shaped fixture and read back again.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS FOUR HUNDRED LINES AND NOT TWENTY ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `PortFixture` and `PortStoreState` are the APP's shapes: `Date`s, camelCase,
 * `number` money, tags as an array on the row, booleans as booleans. A SQLite
 * ledger is none of those things: minor units, ISO text, `YYYY-MM-DD` days,
 * snake_case, 0/1, and two child tables (`transaction_tags`,
 * `suggestion_dismissal_subjects`) where the app holds arrays. Seven entities,
 * both directions. That translation IS the work, and pretending otherwise is
 * how a harness comes to "pass" by comparing two things it converted the same
 * wrong way.
 *
 * ── THE READ-BACK IS INDEPENDENT OF THE PORT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT ───
 *
 * `read()` is the witness for every "the refusal changed nothing" and every
 * "the row really landed" assertion in the contract suite. If it were the
 * port's own reads, all of those would collapse into "the port agrees with
 * itself" — a property that a port which silently writes nothing and reads
 * nothing back satisfies perfectly.
 *
 * So nothing in this file imports `src/services/local`. It goes to the file
 * with `node:sqlite`, and it maps rows into app shapes with the mappers below,
 * which are this file's own. The contract suite does not take that on trust
 * either: the rule *"reads its own store back by some means other than itself"*
 * spies on every operation the port has and fails if `read()` touches one.
 *
 * ── ONE COLUMN TABLE, READ IN BOTH DIRECTIONS ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The independence above is worth having; two independent CONVERSIONS would not
 * be. If the writer decided that £70.10 is 7010 and the reader decided it is
 * 7010 by its own route, a shared mistake in the two routes would still cancel
 * out and a real disagreement between them would look like a fixture bug.
 *
 * So the columns are declared ONCE — {@link ENTITIES} — as (column, app field,
 * kind) triples, and the writer and the reader are two interpretations of the
 * same list. A column added to one direction is added to both by construction.
 * What stays per-entity, and per-direction, is ASSEMBLY: which fields are
 * required, what a NOT NULL column with no app field is filled from, and the
 * two child tables. That is where the app's own defaults live and it is
 * deliberately not shared, because the two directions genuinely differ there.
 *
 * ── SEEDING IS DIRECT SQL, BECAUSE THE WRITES DO NOT EXIST YET ──────────────
 *
 * `LocalDataPort` answers every write now, and seeding through them would be the
 * port-versus-itself mistake in the other direction: a fixture written by the
 * thing under test proves nothing about whether the thing under test writes what
 * it claims. It was originally direct SQL because there were no writes at all;
 * it stays direct SQL for the better reason. PHASE3-PLAN D-6 also rejected the
 * tidier-looking alternative: test-only `seed`/`dump` verbs behind a cargo
 * feature are a SQL-shaped door one build configuration away from shipping.
 *
 * A fixture that the schema refuses is reported with the constraint's own name
 * and the row that broke it, never smoothed over. That is the harness doing its
 * job: the schema is a second opinion about what a ledger may contain, and the
 * first thing it found was a contract fixture with a category on a split parent
 * (`transactions_split_parent_has_blank_category`), which the other three split
 * fixtures in that file already knew not to do.
