/**
 * The app speaks one English, and it is the one its dates are in.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A STYLE NOTE ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every date this app prints is dd/mm/yyyy and every amount is in pounds —
 * `utils/dateFormatter` hard-codes `en-GB` and `isUKDateFormat()` returns a
 * literal `true`, so there is no US edition to be consistent WITH. The copy had
 * drifted anyway: "Uncategorised" in the payee reports and the category name
 * lookup, "Uncategorized" in CategoryContext, the category dropdown, the search
 * results and the QIF export — two spellings of one word, both reachable from
 * the same screen, under dates that could only be British.
 *
 * A sweep fixes that once. This fixes it for good, because the failure mode is
 * not ignorance, it is that `Uncategorized` looks completely correct to
 * whoever types it next.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It reads the copy — quoted strings and JSX text in the components, pages and
 * contexts — and looks for a short list of words that Britain and America spell
 * differently AND that this app actually says. It is not a dictionary and does
 * not pretend to be: `color`, `center` and `behavior` are absent from the list
 * on purpose, because in a React codebase they are overwhelmingly CSS
 * properties and Tailwind classes, and a guard that cries wolf gets deleted.
 *
 * IDENTIFIERS ARE NOT COPY. `BulkCategorizeModal`, `normalizePayee` and
 * `applyCategoryToUncategorized` are names, and renaming them would be churn
 * with no reader. Only what a person can read on screen is in scope, so import
 * lines, module paths and hyphenated/underscored tokens (`data-testid`s, storage
 * keys) are skipped.
 *
 * ── IF A US EDITION EVER SHIPS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The owner's ask was "if they choose US dates, the spelling should follow".
 * There is nothing to follow today — no such choice exists — and building a
 * branch nobody can reach would be worse than not building it. When that choice
 * arrives, this file is the inventory of every word that has to move, and
 * `UNCATEGORISED_LABEL` is the shape the rest should take: one constant, read
 * everywhere, switched in one place.
