# Backup Summary - v1.9.0
Date: 2025-08-26
Version: 1.9.0

## Purpose
Pre-cleanup backup before housekeeping operations to remove temporary files and organize the codebase.

## Major Changes Since v1.8.0
1. **Professional Emphasis Added**: Updated CLAUDE.md to emphasize "professional-grade" alongside "top tier" throughout
2. **Documentation Rename**: Renamed Todo-v5.md to TASKS.md for better clarity
3. **About to Clean**: Removing ~40 temporary files, logs, and test artifacts

## What This Backup Contains
- Complete source code with professional standards documentation
- All configuration files
- Test suites (847 test files)
- Documentation (including updated CLAUDE.md with professional emphasis)
- Database migrations and setup files (before cleanup)

## Statistics Before Cleanup
- ~40 temporary files in root directory
- 6 log files
- 12 SQL migration files
- Multiple .DS_Store files throughout
- 24+ development server test files

## Next Steps After This Backup
1. Remove all log files
2. Archive SQL migration files
3. Remove temporary test HTML/JS files
4. Clean .DS_Store files
5. Keep only last 3 backups

## Files to be Cleaned
- All *.log files
- Test server files (dev-server*.js, test-*.html)
- SQL migration files (moving to archive)
- .DS_Store files throughout codebase

This backup ensures we can recover if needed after the cleanup operations.
