# Backup Summary - v1.4.7
**Date:** 2025-07-22
**Version:** 1.4.7

## Overview
This release focuses on comprehensive performance optimizations to improve load times and user experience.

## Major Changes

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**
   - Enhanced all routes with `lazyWithPreload` utility for intelligent preloading
   - Routes preload during browser idle time
   - Created lazy-loaded Chart.js components (LineChart, DoughnutChart)
   - Deferred ~344KB of Chart.js until actually needed

2. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Configured Vite to split XLSX library into separate chunk
   - Organized vendor bundles by functionality
   - Reduced initial bundle size significantly

3. **Production Compression**
   - Created build script for Gzip and Brotli compression
   - Achieves 70%+ size reduction with Brotli
   - Pre-compressed assets served based on browser support

4. **Image Optimization**
   - Script to generate WebP and AVIF formats
   - 40-60% size reduction for modern image formats
   - Maintains backward compatibility with original formats

5. **HTTP/2 & Caching**
   - Production-ready nginx configuration
   - HTTP/2 multiplexing and server push
   - Optimal caching strategies for different asset types
   - Security headers configured

6. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Lighthouse CI integration
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Performance budgets configured

## Technical Details

### New Scripts
- `npm run build:compress` - Build with compression
- `npm run build:production` - Full production build
- `npm run optimize:images` - Convert images to modern formats
- `npm run perf:analyze` - Run performance analysis

### New Files
- `/src/utils/lazyWithPreload.ts` - Utility for intelligent route preloading
- `/src/components/charts/LineChart.tsx` - Lazy-loaded line chart
- `/src/components/charts/DoughnutChart.tsx` - Lazy-loaded doughnut chart
- `/src/components/charts/LazyChart.tsx` - Wrapper components for lazy loading
- `/scripts/build-with-compression.js` - Compression build script
- `/scripts/optimize-images.js` - Image optimization script
- `/nginx.conf.example` - Production nginx configuration
- `/.lighthouserc.cjs` - Lighthouse CI configuration
- `/.github/workflows/performance.yml` - Performance testing workflow

### Modified Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated to use lazyWithPreload
- `src/pages/Reports.tsx` - Updated to use lazy chart components
- `vite.config.ts` - Added manual chunking for xlsx
- `package.json` - Added new build and optimization scripts

## Performance Improvements
- Initial bundle size reduced through code splitting
- Chart.js loaded only when needed (344KB deferred)
- 70%+ compression with Brotli
- 40-60% image size reduction with modern formats
- Faster route transitions with preloading
- Better caching for repeat visits

## Testing Status
All E2E tests continue to pass at 100% (210/210 tests).

## Deployment
- Git tag: v1.4.7
- GitHub repository updated
- All changes committed and pushed

## Next Steps
Consider implementing:
- CDN integration for global performance
- Service worker enhancements
- Server-side rendering for critical pages
- Further bundle optimizations based on usage patterns
