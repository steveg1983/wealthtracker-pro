# WealthTracker Implementation Tasks
*Last Updated: 2025-09-03 - Internationalization Support Added*

## ✅ COMPLETED: Testing Infrastructure Transformation (2025-09-02)

## NEXT PRIORITY: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration (2025-09-03)

### Overview
The CI pipeline is failing due to missing environment variables. All code fixes have been completed, but the pipeline needs proper secrets configuration to pass all tests.

### Required GitHub Repository Secrets

#### 1. Critical for Tests to Pass
```bash
# Supabase Configuration (REQUIRED)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Clerk Authentication (REQUIRED)  
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your-clerk-key
```

#### 2. Deployment Configuration
```bash
# Vercel Deployment (if using Vercel)
VERCEL_TOKEN=your-vercel-token
VERCEL_ORG_ID=your-org-id
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

### Steps to Complete

1. **Add GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add each secret listed above with actual values
   - Ensure Supabase URL and keys match your test environment

2. **Verify Test Environment**:
   - Confirm Supabase project has correct schema (check migrations)
   - Ensure test database is accessible from GitHub Actions
   - Verify Clerk test keys are active

3. **Monitor CI Pipeline**:
   - After adding secrets, push any small change to trigger CI
   - Watch GitHub Actions tab for test results
   - All tests should pass once secrets are configured

### Current CI Status
- ✅ Code Quality checks fixed (console.log removed, bundle check working)
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities resolved (jspdf updated)
- ✅ Vercel deployment errors fixed (CSP and module issues)
- ⏳ Unit/Integration tests need database credentials
- ⏳ E2E tests need authentication setup

### Files Already Fixed
- `.console-allowlist.txt` - Added legitimate console.log files
- `scripts/bundle-size-check.js` - Fixed variable reference error
- `vercel.json` - Updated CSP to allow data: fonts
- `vite.config.ts` - Added CommonJS compatibility
- `.github/CI_SETUP.md` - Complete setup documentation created

### Expected Outcome
Once secrets are added, the CI pipeline should show:
- ✅ Code Quality - Pass
- ✅ Unit & Integration Tests - Pass  
- ✅ Security Scan - Pass (only dev dependency warnings)
- ✅ E2E Tests (all browsers) - Pass
- ✅ Build - Pass
- ✅ Deploy - Pass
