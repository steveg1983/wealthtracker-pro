# Accessibility Testing Quick Start

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Run Automated Checks First
```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the accessibility check
node scripts/check-accessibility.js
```

### 2. Open the Test Results Document
Open `ACCESSIBILITY_TEST_RESULTS.md` and use it to track your manual testing.

## üîç Priority Testing Areas

### Critical Components to Test

#### 1. Add Transaction Modal (Most Complex Form)
**Why**: This is the most frequently used form with multiple validation states

**Screen Reader Test**:
- Press "Add Transaction" button
- Verify modal title is announced
- Tab through type buttons - verify aria-pressed states work
- Test each field - verify labels are announced
- Submit with errors - verify errors are announced immediately
- Submit successfully - verify success message

**Color Contrast**:
- Red expense button
- Green income button
- Error messages (red text)
- Form labels

#### 2. Financial Amounts Display
**Why**: Custom formatting with color coding needs verification

**Screen Reader Test**:
- Navigate to transactions list
- Verify negative amounts are announced with minus sign
- Verify positive amounts are announced clearly

**Color Contrast**:
- Red text for negative amounts (#ef4444 on white)
- Green text for positive amounts (#10b981 on white)
- Should be 4.5:1 ratio minimum

#### 3. Table Headers
**Why**: White text on blue background (#8EA9DB) is a known risk area

**Color Contrast**:
- Check all table headers
- Should have 4.5:1 ratio
- Test in both light and dark modes

#### 4. Skip Links
**Why**: Essential for keyboard navigation

**Keyboard Test**:
- Load any page
- Press Tab once
- Skip links should appear
- Press Enter to activate
- Focus should jump to main content

## ‚è± Time Estimate

- Automated check: 2 minutes
- Critical manual testing: 20 minutes
- Full manual testing: 45-60 minutes
