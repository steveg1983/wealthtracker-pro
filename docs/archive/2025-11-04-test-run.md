# 2025-11-04 Test Runner Incident (Archived)

This note consolidates the information that previously lived in `QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md`, `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`, and `TEST_FAILURES_SUMMARY.md`.

## Context
- **Environment**: Codex CLI harness (npm commands timing out)
- **Action**: Ran `npx vitest run` directly to bypass npm wrapper timeouts
- **Runtime**: ~28 minutes before manual stop (suite was still progressing)

## Findings
| Suite | Failures | Root Cause (at the time) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ReconciliationModal.test.tsx` | 51 | Missing `PreferencesProvider` in setup |
| `BudgetContext.test.tsx` | 8 | `getBudgetByCategory()` regression |
| `recurringTransactionsSlice.test.ts` | 2 | Object-shape drift after Decimal migration |
| `GoalModal.test.tsx` | 4 | Brittle text matcher |

All issues above were fixed in subsequent commits, and the current suite is green.

## Runners Added
- `scripts/run-tests-direct.mjs` → `npm run test:direct`
- `scripts/run-all-tests.mjs` → `npm run test:batched`

These commands remain available for future long‑running test investigations, but the standalone Markdown files have been retired to avoid confusion.
