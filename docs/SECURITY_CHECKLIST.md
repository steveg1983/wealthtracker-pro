# Security Checklist

## Daily Checks

- [ ] Monitor application logs for security events
- [ ] Check for failed encryption/decryption attempts
- [ ] Review CSP violation reports (when implemented)

## Weekly Checks

- [ ] Run `npm audit` to check for new vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review dependency updates for security patches
- [ ] Check GitHub Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Verify security headers are properly configured

## Monthly Checks

- [ ] Full security audit using OWASP tools
- [ ] Review and update CSP directives based on usage
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption functionality
- [ ] Verify XSS protection is working correctly
- [ ] Review access logs for suspicious patterns

## Quarterly Checks

- [ ] Comprehensive penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update security documentation
- [ ] Security training for development team
- [ ] Review and rotate encryption keys
- [ ] Update security dependencies

## Before Each Release

### Code Review
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] All user inputs are sanitized
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- [ ] No console.log statements with sensitive data
- [ ] Error messages don't expose system details

### Dependencies
- [ ] Run `npm audit fix`
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Review new dependencies for security issues
- [ ] Check licenses for compliance

### Security Headers
- [ ] CSP headers are configured correctly
- [ ] HSTS is enabled for production
- [ ] X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME sniffing

### Data Protection
- [ ] Encryption is working for all sensitive data
- [ ] Data sanitization is applied to all inputs
- [ ] No sensitive data in URL parameters
- [ ] Session data is properly secured

### Testing
- [ ] Run security test suite
- [ ] Test XSS protection with payloads
- [ ] Verify CSP blocks unauthorized resources
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption edge cases

## Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:

1. **Assess Impact**
   - Determine scope of vulnerability
   - Check if it's being actively exploited
   - Identify affected users/data

2. **Immediate Actions**
   - Apply temporary mitigation if possible
   - Document the issue thoroughly
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

3. **Fix Development**
   - Create fix on separate branch
   - Thoroughly test the fix
   - Get security review of fix

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy fix to production ASAP
   - Monitor for any issues
   - Verify vulnerability is resolved

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures
   - Add tests to prevent recurrence
