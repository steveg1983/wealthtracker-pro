   - Should test all major user flows
   - Verify announcements, navigation, and form interactions
   - Best done with users who regularly use screen readers

2. **Performance Testing** (for future reference)
   - Real device testing on low-end hardware
   - Network throttling tests
   - Large dataset performance validation

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Safari on macOS/iOS
   - Firefox
   - Edge
   - Mobile browsers
