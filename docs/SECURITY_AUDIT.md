   # Option 2: Update to a patched fork (if available)
   # Option 3: Implement strict input validation for xlsx operations
   ```

2. **Update Vercel**
   ```bash
   npm install vercel@25.2.0 --save-dev
   ```

3. **Update/Remove localtunnel**
   ```bash
   # If needed for development
   npm install localtunnel@1.8.3 --save-dev
   
   # Or remove if not used
   npm uninstall localtunnel
   ```

### High Priority

1. **Implement Dependency Scanning in CI/CD**
2. **Set up automated security updates**
3. **Configure security monitoring**

## Conclusion

The Wealth Tracker application has implemented strong security measures including CSP, XSS protection, and data encryption. However, there are several vulnerable dependencies that need immediate attention.

**Overall Security Score**: 7/10

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive encryption implementation
- Strong XSS protection
- Well-configured security headers

**Key Weaknesses**:
- Vulnerable dependencies (especially xlsx)
- Lack of automated security scanning
- Missing security monitoring

By addressing the identified vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended improvements, the security posture can be significantly enhanced.
