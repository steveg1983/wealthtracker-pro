Owner: Project Engineering Manager
Last updated: 2025-09-29 21:30 UTC
Status: 🔴 **AUDIT COMPLETE** – Senior engineer audit reveals D+ grade (30/100). **NOT ENTERPRISE READY**. 5 critical blockers identified: ESLint (24,808 problems), financial safety (158 files), type bypasses (245 "as any"), broken tests, bundle size (2x over target). Strict TypeScript: 0 errors ✅. Actual completion: **25-30% toward world-class** (audit-verified). Systematic remediation roadmap: 600-800 hours to enterprise ready.
Authoritative scope: Vision, rules, procedures, audit findings, recovery status, and world-class roadmap.

---

## 1. Mission & Non-Negotiable Standards
- Build the #1 professional personal finance platform with "just works" reliability.
- Subscription SaaS, multi-tenant, secure by default, WCAG 2.1 AA accessible.
- Financial software tolerates **zero** data loss, precision errors, or guesswork.
- **Apple/Google/Microsoft code quality** is the only acceptable standard.
- This document is the **single source of truth**. If it conflicts with other files, this one wins.

---

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Professional Excellence** – Verify every assumption; "good enough" is failure.
2. **Read First, Code Second** – Understand implementations before touching them.
3. **Slower Is Faster** – Diagnose before acting; revert if you feel rushed.
4. **Functional before Cosmetic** – Features must actually work end-to-end.
5. **Financial Integrity** – No floating-point money math; use Decimal.js or precise value objects.
6. **No Half Measures** – If you start a feature, you finish it: UI, services, database, tests, docs.
7. **Testing Reality** – Mocks are last resort; connect to real infrastructure whenever feasible.
8. **Verification Discipline** – Every change runs the full gate (`npm run build:check`, lint, tests) before commit.
9. **Documentation of Why** – Leave breadcrumbs for the next engineer; explain reasoning, not syntax.
10. **Absolute Type Safety** – ZERO `as any` anywhere, ever. No exceptions, no approvals, no compromises.

---

## 3. Operating Procedures & Guardrails
### 3.1 Backup Doctrine
```bash
cp -r src src.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_BEFORE_WORK
# After meaningful milestones (~10 files or major fix)
cp -r src src.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_CHECKPOINT
```
Rollback immediately if verification fails.

### 3.2 Verification Rhythm
```bash
BEFORE=$(npx tsc -p tsconfig.strict.json --noEmit 2>&1 | rg -c "error TS" || echo "fail")
# make one focused change
AFTER=$(npx tsc -p tsconfig.strict.json --noEmit 2>&1 | rg -c "error TS")
```
- Error count must trend down; if it rises, revert.
- Big-picture checks after each session: `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm test --run`, `npm run bundle:report`.

### 3.3 One-File Law
- Change **one logical unit** at a time. No mass find-replace. No reckless scripts.
- Understand ripple effects before modifying shared hooks, services, or contexts.

### 3.4 Documentation Imperative
Log every change (file, line, reason, verification result). Update this bible if procedures or priorities shift.

### 3.5 No-Cowboy Clause (Instant Stop)
- Mass edits without review.
- Silencing errors with `as any` or TODO placeholders.
- Deleting code to "make things compile."
Violations require rollback, root-cause doc, and prevention measures.

### 3.6 Absolute Type Safety Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**THE ULTIMATE RULE: ZERO "AS ANY" TOLERANCE**

- **ZERO** `as any` in the codebase - not one, not ever
- **ZERO** exceptions - senior engineer approval DOES NOT override this rule
- **ZERO** "temporary" usage - if you can't type it properly, don't write it
- **ZERO** tolerance - `as any` in a PR = automatic rejection, no discussion

**Why This Exists:**
- `as any` completely destroys TypeScript's type safety
- Hides runtime errors that crash in production
- Makes refactoring dangerous and unpredictable
- World-class codebases at Apple/Google/Microsoft ban this completely

**What To Do Instead:**
1. **Create proper type definitions** - invest time in correct types
2. **Use type guards** - `if (typeof x === 'string')` instead of `as any`
3. **Use unknown + narrowing** - but NEVER `as unknown as T` (also banned)
4. **Ask for help** - if stuck on types, ask before bypassing
5. **Refactor the code** - if it can't be typed, redesign it

**Current Reality:** 245 `as any` violations across 116 files = enterprise blocker

### 3.7 Documentation Maintenance & Backup Policy

**CLAUDE.md Update Frequency:**
- Update metrics **immediately** after significant changes (lint fixes, bundle changes, test improvements)
- Update status section **weekly** during active development
- Update roadmap **monthly** or when priorities shift
- Trigger: Any time reality diverges from documentation by >10%

**Backup Management:**
- Keep **maximum 3 most recent** CLAUDE.md backups
- Create backup before major restructuring: `cp CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)`
- Delete oldest backup when creating 4th backup
- Automated cleanup script: `scripts/cleanup-backups.sh`

**Source Code Backup Policy:**
- Keep **maximum 3 most recent** `src.backup.*` directories
- Create backup before risky changes only (not routine work)
- Delete oldest backup when exceeding 3 copies
- **CRITICAL**: Exclude all `src.backup.*` from linting and testing tools
- Automated cleanup: `scripts/cleanup-backups.sh`

**Maintenance Checklist (Weekly):**
- [ ] Update Section 5 metrics if changed
- [ ] Clean old backups (max 3): `bash scripts/cleanup-backups.sh`
- [ ] Verify tool exclusions (`.eslintignore`, `vitest.config.ts`)
- [ ] Check changelog is current

---

## 4. Quality Gates & Reference Commands
```bash
npm run build:check      # tsc -b + vite build
npx tsc -p tsconfig.strict.json --noEmit
npm run lint             # ESLint (strict rules)
npm test --run           # Vitest focused run
npm run test:real        # Integration tests w/ real services
npm run bundle:report    # Bundle size analysis
npm run lighthouse       # Performance budget verification
```
`npm run build:check` now runs the strict profile first. **MUST ADD**: Husky pre-commit hook to run `npm run typecheck:strict && npm run lint` before committing.

### 6 Critical Enterprise Blockers (ChatGPT-Verified 2025-09-29)

**🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY** (ChatGPT Second Opinion):
Lint/test catastrophe is **partially inflated by backup directories**. Multiple `src.backup.*` folders are being scanned by ESLint and Vitest, artificially multiplying problem counts. **Phase 0 (Repository Hygiene) is now mandatory first step** before accurate assessment possible.

**BLOCKER #1: Repository Hygiene** 🚨 **NEW - DO THIS FIRST**
- Multiple `src.backup.*` directories polluting lint/test metrics
- Backup dirs not excluded from `.eslintignore` or `vitest.config.ts`
- **ChatGPT Finding**: ~90% of problems are duplicate scans of old code
- **Impact**: Cannot get accurate baseline, wasting effort on ghost issues
- **Fix Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Action**: Delete old backups OR exclude from tools, then re-baseline

**BLOCKER #2: Linting Issues** 🚨 (Revised Estimate)
- **Current metrics**: 624 errors + 24,184 warnings = 24,808 problems
- **Expected after Phase 0**: ~50-100 actual errors (90% reduction)
- **ChatGPT Verification**: Confirmed real issues exist (regex escaping in `vite.config.ts`, unused imports)
- World-class standard: 0 errors, <50 warnings
- **Impact**: Still blocks code review, but not catastrophic
- **Fix Effort**: 20-40 hours (down from 80-100 after cleanup)

**BLOCKER #3: Financial Calculation Safety** 🚨 (Confirmed Accurate)
- **Original audit**: 158 files using `parseFloat()`, `toFixed()`, `Math.round()`
- **ChatGPT Verification**: 162 parseFloat hits, 358 toFixed hits (confirms scope)
- Violations: `src/utils/currency.ts:70`, `src/types/money.ts:8`
- **Impact**: Compliance violation, legal liability, cannot pass SOC 2/PCI-DSS
- **Fix Effort**: 80-100 hours (unchanged - this is real)

**BLOCKER #4: Type Safety Bypassed** 🚨 (Confirmed Accurate)
- **Original audit**: 245 `as any` across 116 files
- **ChatGPT Verification**: Exact match - 245 occurrences (confirms accuracy)
- Complete bypass of TypeScript protection in service responses, contexts
- **Impact**: Runtime errors hidden, refactoring dangerous, high production risk
- **Fix Effort**: 60-80 hours (unchanged)

**BLOCKER #5: Testing Infrastructure** 🚨 (Revised Understanding)
- **Current**: Tests timeout after 15min, 730 files / 1,651 assertions failing
- **ChatGPT Root Cause**: Vitest executing copies in `src.backup.*` + real issues
- **Expected after Phase 0**: Tests run <5min with <100 manageable failures
- **Impact**: Cannot verify quality until Phase 0 cleanup
- **Fix Effort**: 60-80 hours (but 80% faster after Phase 0)

**BLOCKER #6: Bundle Size Performance** 🚨 (Revised Metrics - ChatGPT Correction)
- **Original claim**: React core 390KB gzip
- **ChatGPT Correction**: React core is actually **46KB gzip** ✅ (excellent progress!)
- **Actual current state**: Initial load ~580KB gzip (vendor-shared 0.58MB + index 0.13MB)
- **Target**: <200KB gzip
- **Gap**: ~3x over target (better than originally thought, but still significant)
- **Impact**: Slow mobile experience, but improving
- **Fix Effort**: 40-60 hours (unchanged)

### What's Actually World-Class ✅

1. **Security** (8/10) - Genuinely Apple/Google level
   - XSS protection, input sanitization, Sentry integration
2. **TypeScript Strict** (10/10) - 0 errors shows discipline
3. **Stack Choices** (9/10) - Modern, scalable choices
4. **Documentation** (7/10) - Above average

### The Brutal Truth

**Would this pass Apple/Google/Microsoft code review?**
**NO.** Immediate rejection due to:
- 624 linting errors (0 is the standard)
- Floating-point in financial code (compliance violation)
- 245 type bypasses (indicates shortcuts)
- Broken testing (cannot verify quality)

**Time to Enterprise Ready**: 470-630 hours (12-16 weeks single engineer) - revised down after ChatGPT analysis
**With 2-3 Engineers**: 6-8 weeks to world-class (revised from 2-3 months)

**Current Build Status:**
- ✅ TypeScript strict: 0 errors
- 🔴 ESLint: 624 errors, 24,184 warnings
- 🔴 Tests: Timeout
- ✅ Bundle: Optimized but 2x over target
- Latest: `vendor-plotly` 1.24MB (0.42MB gzip), `vendor-export` 1.14MB (0.35MB gzip)

Backups available under `src.backup.*`. Validate timestamp before using.

## 6. Roadmap to World-Class (Audit-Driven Priorities)

### PHASE 0: REPOSITORY HYGIENE (4-6 hours) 🚨 **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**
**Goal**: Get accurate baseline metrics by cleaning tool pollution
**Exit Criteria**: Lint/test tools only scan active code, accurate problem counts

**Discovery**: ChatGPT second opinion (2025-09-29) revealed that backup directories (`src.backup.*`) are inflating metrics by ~90%. Must clean before proceeding with any other work.

1. **Clean Backup Directories** (2 hours) - BLOCKER REMOVAL
   ```bash
   # Option A: Delete all old backups (recommended for clean start)
   rm -rf src.backup.*

   # Option B: Move to archive outside src/
   mkdir -p ../wealthtracker-archives
   mv src.backup.* ../wealthtracker-archives/

   # Option C: Keep max 3 recent backups, exclude from tools
   bash scripts/cleanup-backups.sh
   ```

2. **Update Tool Exclusions** (1 hour)
   - Add `src.backup.*` and `dist/` to `.eslintignore`
   - Add `src.backup.*` to `vitest.config.ts` exclude array
   - Verify `.gitignore` excludes backups
   - Test: `npm run lint` should only scan src/ (not backups)

3. **Establish Clean Baseline** (1 hour)
   ```bash
   npm run lint 2>&1 | tee logs/lint-clean-baseline-$(date +%Y%m%d).log
   npm run test -- --run 2>&1 | tee logs/test-clean-baseline-$(date +%Y%m%d).log
   npm run typecheck:strict 2>&1 | tee logs/tsc-clean-baseline-$(date +%Y%m%d).log
   ```

4. **Update Documentation** (30min-1 hour)
   - Update Section 5 metrics with actual numbers
   - Record baseline in `docs/recovery-status.md`
   - Update Phase 1-5 estimates based on reality

**Expected Outcome**:
- Lint errors: **624 → ~50-100** (90% reduction)
- Test runtime: **Timeout → <5 minutes**
- Test failures: **1,651 → <100** manageable failures
- **Accurate** problem counts to prioritize real work

**Deliverable**: Clean metrics, realistic roadmap, no tool pollution

### PHASE 1: STABILIZE QUALITY GATES (120-160 hours) 🚨 REVISED ESTIMATE
**Goal**: Fix real linting/testing issues (not duplicates from backups)
**Exit Criteria**: All quality gates pass, tests run reliably
**Note**: Estimates reduced from 200-240 hours based on Phase 0 cleanup revealing true scope

1. **Fix Linting** (20-40 hours) - REVISED DOWN FROM 80-100
   - Fix ~50-100 actual errors (after Phase 0 cleanup removes duplicates)
   - Address real issues: regex escaping in `vite.config.ts`, unused imports
   - Clean up remaining warnings with justification
   - Target: 0 errors, <50 warnings

2. **Fix Testing Infrastructure** (60-80 hours) - MOSTLY UNCHANGED
   - Fix real test failures (reducers without stores, Supabase stubs)

**Pass Criteria**: 100% checklist completion = World-class ready

---

## 8. Architectural & Coding Standards
- **Frontend stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Redux Toolkit + TailwindCSS.
- **Component pattern:** hooks at top, handlers next, JSX last (`src/components/*`).
- **Testing pattern:** Vitest + React Testing Library; use `vi` mocks sparingly, prefer real services.
- **Service pattern:** Export interfaces in `src/services/interfaces`. Implementations inject dependencies via `ServiceProvider`.
- **Decimal usage:** `Decimal.js` everywhere that handles currency; keep amounts as strings/`Decimal` until final presentation.
- **ID handling:** Clerk IDs must convert to DB UUIDs via `userIdService` before data access.
- **Security:** sanitize inputs via `security/xss-protection`, never trust browser input.
- **Performance:** Desktop-first responsive design; lazy-load heavy components; always verify Lighthouse budgets.
- **Type Safety:** ZERO `as any` - use proper type definitions, type guards, and refactor if needed.

---

## 9. Handoff & Daily Workflow Checklist
### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Read relevant codepaths; confirm understanding.
- [ ] Capture strict TS error count + ESLint count.
- [ ] Create fresh backup (`src.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description`).
- [ ] Review current enterprise blockers from audit

### During Work
- [ ] Make atomic changes; document rationale.
- [ ] Re-run strict `tsc` after each logical change.
- [ ] Keep log of error deltas and affected files.
- [ ] Update this bible if rules or priorities change.
- [ ] **NEVER** use `as any` - ask for help if stuck on types

### Before Committing / Handoff
- [ ] `npm run build:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm test --run` all succeed.
- [ ] `npm run bundle:report` reviewed; chunk growth justified.
- [ ] No `console.log`, no commented-out code, no `as any`.
- [ ] Documentation updated (`docs/`, this bible, changelog).
- [ ] Record final strict error count + ESLint count + summary.

### Emergency Protocol
1. Stop immediately when counts spike or build fails.
2. Restore latest backup.
3. Document cause, fix, and mitigation here.
4. Inform team before resuming.

---

## 10. Disaster Prevention & Lessons Learned
- **"Quick fix" finds** caused past 11k-error explosions. Never again.
- **"Cleanup" deletions** removed live components; archive instead of delete.
- **"Silence errors"** with `as any` masked runtime crashes; fix the root issue.
- **"Refactor in bulk"** created circular dependencies; redesign first, then execute incrementally.
- **"as any" shortcuts** create technical debt that becomes enterprise blockers.

---

## 11. Documentation Change Control
- Any adjustment to rules, procedures, or roadmap **must** be reflected here immediately.
- Append a brief entry to `## Changelog` with date, author, and summary.
- Full history maintained in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for traceability.

## 13. Session Reboot Prompt
When a conversation resets or a new assistant joins, paste this message:

```
You are resuming work on WealthTracker. IMMEDIATELY read `CLAUDE.md` (the Single Engineering Bible).

**CRITICAL CONTEXT**:
- Senior engineer audit (2025-09-29) + ChatGPT verification revealed D+ grade (30/100) - NOT enterprise ready
- **Phase 0 discovery**: Backup directories (`src.backup.*`) inflating metrics by ~90% - must clean first
- Actual completion: 25-30% toward world-class
- 6 critical blockers (Phase 0 hygiene is #1 priority)

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ZERO `as any` tolerance - no exceptions, no approvals. Current: 245 violations.

**PRIORITY ORDER** (from dual audit):
1. **Phase 0: Repository hygiene** (4-6 hours) - GET ACCURATE BASELINE FIRST
2. Fix linting (~50-100 real errors after cleanup)
3. Fix tests (will be <5min after cleanup)
4. Financial Decimal migration (158 files confirmed)
5. Eliminate all "as any" (245 confirmed)
6. Bundle optimization (580KB→200KB target)

Review Section 5 (audit findings), Section 6 (roadmap with Phase 0), Section 7 (world-class checklist). **Start with Phase 0 before any other work.**
