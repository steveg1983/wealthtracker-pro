-- ============================================================================
-- VENDORED COPY — provenance
-- ============================================================================
-- Origin: the Phase 1 local-edition design draft, written to the session
--         scratchpad as local-core/schema.sql and companion to local-core/
--         DESIGN.md. Copied here on 2026-08-08, byte-for-byte below this
--         header, so the constraint harness has a version-controlled schema to
--         test rather than a file in a temp directory.
--
-- Status: NOT a migration. Nothing applies this to any database except
--         scripts/local-sqlite/run.mjs, which applies it to a throwaway file.
--         supabase/migrations/ remains the only schema anything ships.
--
-- Rule:   this file is a COPY, not a fork. Edit the design first, re-copy, and
--         re-run `npm run test:local-sqlite`. A change made only here is drift,
--         and the parity table in README.md stops meaning anything.
--
-- AMENDED 2026-08-08, in BOTH copies together, by the differential harness:
--         the harness found C-3 and C-4 classified as ported triggers in
--         DESIGN.md §1.4 and absent from the DDL — a new account got no
--         To/From category, and a renamed one kept the old category name.
--         trg_create_transfer_category_for_account and
--         trg_sync_transfer_category_for_account were written from
--         supabase/migrations/20260708140000_transfer_categories_lifecycle.sql,
--         and trg_protect_transfer_category regained the users-row clause it
--         had dropped (C-5): without it DELETE FROM users is refused outright.
--         Both copies were edited in the same change and diffed to prove they
--         differ by this header alone:
--             diff <(tail -n +35 scripts/local-sqlite/schema.sql) \
--                  <scratchpad>/local-core/schema.sql   -> no output
--         (35 = this header is 34 lines; the rest is the original, verbatim.)
--         Specs: specs/c3-*, specs/c4-*, specs/c5-*.
--
-- AMENDED 2026-08-08 (2), by the verb harness: transactions.category_confirmed
--         was missing. The design draft predates
--         supabase/migrations/20260808100000_category_provenance.sql, which
--         added the column to the cloud AND to create_transaction_atomic's
--         column list. Porting that RPC without the column is not possible, so
--         the column was added here with the cloud's default (1 = confirmed)
--         and the cloud's reasoning quoted at the definition.
--         This copy is now AHEAD of the scratchpad draft by that one column;
--         the draft is a design document and this file is what executes, so
--         when the two are reconciled this is the direction the change travels.
--         Specs: verb-specs/create-transaction-carries-*.spec.mjs.
--
-- AMENDED 2026-08-08 (3), in BOTH copies together, discharging the parity
--         obligation recorded at
--         supabase/migrations/20260808170000_rows_cannot_name_a_foreign_account
--         .sql:241-249. The cloud widened SEVEN foreign keys from (account) to
--         (account, owner) so that "this row's account belongs to this row's
--         user" is a shape the table will accept rather than a WHERE clause
--         every writer must remember. Until this file matched, the two engines
--         disagreed about what a LEGAL ROW IS, and the differential harness was
--         measuring a difference in schemas rather than a difference in
--         implementations — which is the one thing it must never do.
--         The same seven keys are here, plus the anchor they point at
--         (accounts_id_user_unique). See "THE OWNERSHIP PAIRING" below for the
--         one place the two engines had to reach the same behaviour by
--         different mechanisms: SQLite has no `ON DELETE SET NULL (column)`.
--         Both copies were edited in the same change and diffed to prove they
--         differ by this header and by amendment (2)'s one column alone:
--             diff <(tail -n +72 scripts/local-sqlite/schema.sql |
--                      sed '/-- Has a human vouched/,/^$/d') \
--                  <scratchpad>/local-core/schema.sql   -> no output
--         (72 = this header is 69 lines and two blank ones; the rest is the
--          original, verbatim, minus the one column amendment (2) declared
--          this copy ahead by.)
--         Specs: specs/r12-*.
--
-- AMENDED 2026-08-08 (4), in BOTH copies together, by the verb harness again:
--         v_integrity_violations gained `entity` and `severity` columns and the
--         TWO INGEST CHECKS PHASE1-PLAN §2.5 owes it — fifteen checks become
--         seventeen, fifteen hard and two advisory — and v_integrity_ok now
--         counts only the hard ones. The section's own header comment was also
--         CORRECTED: it claimed every check had a Postgres twin the differential
--         harness could compare names against, and there is no such twin; the
--         correction carries the trace that establishes it.
--         Both copies were edited in the same change and diffed to prove they
--         differ by this header and by amendment (2)'s one column alone:
--             diff <(tail -n +88 scripts/local-sqlite/schema.sql |
--                      sed '/-- Has a human vouched/,/^$/d') \
--                  <scratchpad>/local-core/schema.sql   -> no output
--         (88 = this header is 85 lines and two blank ones.)
--         Specs: verb-specs/integrity-*.
--
-- AMENDED 2026-08-09 (5), in THIS COPY ONLY, mirroring
--         supabase/migrations/20260809160000_preferences_that_travel.sql:
--         `user_preferences`, one row per user holding the settings that belong
--         to the ACCOUNT rather than to the browser. A cloud backup carries the
--         document (services/backupService writes it as a top-level
--         `preferences` section), so a local file that could not hold it would
--         restore the ledger and drop every choice about how to read it —
--         which is the exact failure the cloud migration exists to fix.
--
--         THIS COPY ONLY, on amendment (2)'s precedent and for the same reason:
--         the scratchpad draft predates the cloud migration, this file is what
--         executes, and when the two are reconciled the change travels in this
--         direction. This copy is now ahead of the draft by amendment (2)'s one
--         column and by this one table.
--
--         NO OWNERSHIP PAIRING, and that is not an omission: the composite-FK
--         pattern of 20260808170000 exists so that a row naming an ACCOUNT
--         cannot name one belonging to somebody else. user_preferences names no
--         account — it references users(id) alone, which is the anchor the
--         pairing is built from, not a thing that needs pairing. Account ids do
--         appear INSIDE the document (dashboardKeyAccounts, the archive
--         overrides), and they are unreferencable text there by construction:
--         see the note at the table.
--
-- AMENDED 2026-08-10 (6), in THIS COPY ONLY, mirroring
--         supabase/migrations/20260810090000_imported_rows_arrive_new.sql:
--         `transactions.needs_review`, the Microsoft Money "this arrived and
--         nobody has looked at it" bit. Added on amendment (2)'s precedent and
--         for the same reason — the scratchpad draft predates the cloud
--         migration, this file is what executes, and when the two are
--         reconciled the change travels in this direction. This copy is now
--         ahead of the draft by amendment (2)'s one column, amendment (5)'s one
--         table, and this one column.
--
--         DEFAULT 0 (= reviewed), matching the cloud's `NOT NULL DEFAULT
--         false`, for the reason the cloud gives at length: silence must be
--         safe, so a writer that has never heard of the column produces a
--         reviewed row and existing history reads as reviewed without being
--         rewritten. The two IMPORT verbs are what set it to 1; the create verb
--         deliberately does not, so a row a person typed is born reviewed.
--
--         PARITY OBLIGATION — RETIRED 2026-08-11, by ruling rather than by
--         edit. 20260810090000 is now confirmed applied in the reference
--         cluster, which is the condition this note originally waited on. But
--         the obligation as written predates slice 19's ruling and conflicts
--         with it: ROW_JSON is the Postgres twin of the crate's audit
--         projection, and that projection deliberately excludes needs_review —
--         the audit payload is hash-chained and compared field by field across
--         engines, so widening it re-chains history to say what the review
--         flag already says elsewhere. The field's read-back home is the
--         RESULT projection, which belongs to the commit that gives the port
--         a caller (slice 27, recorded in localDataPort.ts's header). Until
--         then the boot read (BOOT columns) is where needs_review crosses,
--         and it does.
--
--         THE PARITY IS NOW REAL — slice 27 built that result projection.
--         `crate::row::WrittenTransaction` is the audit row plus this column
--         and is what every write ANSWERS with; `crate::row::TransactionRow`
--         is what the chain records and is byte-for-byte what it was. ROW_JSON
--         is the twin of the FIRST of those, so it projects needs_review and
--         all 467 verb specs compare the two engines on it. The audit half is
--         held by two of the crate's own tests (row.rs asserts the audit
--         projection's exact key list; tests/update_transaction.rs reads the
--         stored payload back and fails if the key appears). So the column now
--         crosses on THREE paths — the boot read, a write's answer, and
--         neither the audit nor the chain.
--
-- AMENDED 2026-08-11 (7), in THIS COPY ONLY, mirroring
--         supabase/migrations/20260810200000_marking_is_not_reconciling.sql:
--         `transactions.is_reconciled`, Microsoft Money's R — the committed
--         state only a finalize produces — and with it the reconcile-sweep moved
--         onto that flag and a new CHECK that committed implies marked. Added on
--         amendment (2)'s precedent and for the same reason. This copy is now
--         ahead of the draft by amendment (2)'s one column, amendment (5)'s one
--         table, amendment (6)'s one column and this one column.
--
--         THE CLOUD'S NULL STORY, TRANSLATED AND MEASURED. The migration adds
--         the column bare and sets the default in a SECOND statement, so that
--         history keeps the honest NULL ("ask is_cleared") and only new rows get
--         false. Neither half of that is available or needed here: MEASURED
--         (probe-addcolumn.mjs), SQLite's ADD COLUMN with a DEFAULT gives rows
--         written before the alter that default — attmissingval by another name
--         — and `ALTER COLUMN … SET DEFAULT` is a syntax error, so the two-step
--         cannot be written. A file created from this schema has no pre-split
--         rows, so DEFAULT 0 is right for every INSERT and matches the cloud's
--         answer for one. The column stays NULLABLE because a restored cloud
--         backup's rows really are pre-split, and the obligation that leaves is
--         recorded at the column: `crate::backup` currently turns a JSON null
--         into "column omitted", which the default then fills.
--
--         The accounts side of the same migration was already here: slice 20
--         added last_reconciled_balance_minor for AccountUpdate's sake.
--         Specs: specs/a3-*, verb-specs/cleared-*, verb-specs/finalize-*,
--         verb-specs/archive-*, verb-specs/unarchive-*.
--
-- AMENDED 2026-08-11 (8), COMMENT ONLY — no DDL, no column, no constraint, no
--         trigger. Recorded as an amendment anyway, because the comment it
--         changes is a RECORDED OBLIGATION and retiring one silently is how a
--         file's documentation stops being evidence.
--
--         Amendment (7) left the obligation at `transactions.is_reconciled`:
--         a restored cloud backup's rows carry NULL for the whole of a user's
--         history, and `crate::backup` turned an absent or JSON-null key into
--         "column omitted", which the DEFAULT 0 then filled. Slice 25 built the
--         collector that closes the round trip, so the rule became measurable —
--         and the differential harness immediately corrected it: the fix the
--         obligation predicted (tell absent from null) still filled an ABSENT
--         key from the default, and the cloud does not. 20260811090000 fills a
--         silence for exactly one class, NOT NULL columns with a constant
--         default, so a nullable column is out of reach on both engines.
--
--         The column and its DEFAULT 0 are UNCHANGED and still right: the
--         default is what a VERB's INSERT gets when it says nothing about the
--         flag, which is the migration's "a transaction is born uncommitted
--         whether it was typed, imported or downloaded". What changed is who
--         may reach it — a restore no longer can.
--         Specs: verb-specs/restore-a-deliberate-null-*, and the crate's
--         tests/backup_round_trip.rs.
--
-- AMENDED 2026-08-11 (9), in THIS COPY ONLY, and it changes NO STORAGE: the two
--         CHECKs on `user_preferences` were anonymous and are now NAMED, with
--         the cloud's own names —  `user_preferences_prefs_is_object` and
--         `user_preferences_prefs_is_small` (20260809160000:176, :181). No
--         column, no table, no trigger, no default and no admitted value
--         changes; a document this schema accepted yesterday it accepts today.
--
--         WHY IT IS WORTH AN AMENDMENT ANYWAY. Slice 28 gave the table its
--         verbs, and the first differential spec written against them could not
--         name the refusal it was asserting: SQLite reports an anonymous CHECK
--         as `CHECK constraint failed:` followed by the EXPRESSION, and Postgres
--         reports the constraint's name. So one refusal needed two `expect`
--         strings, and the harness's whole rule about naming a refusal — *"what
--         separates 'the right rule fired' from 'something went wrong'"* —
--         was being kept by matching on a fragment of SQL. Both engines now
--         refuse under one name, and the spec asserts it once.
--
--         The trigger question, answered here because this is where somebody
--         will look for it: `user_preferences` has NO triggers, on purpose. The
--         cloud stamps `updated_at` with `update_user_preferences_updated_at`;
--         this file ports four of the cloud's eleven `updated_at` triggers (see
--         the note at that block) and `write_preferences` writes its own stamp,
--         exactly as the planning family's six verbs do.
--         Specs: verb-specs/preferences-*, and the crate's tests/preferences.rs.
-- ============================================================================


-- ============================================================================
-- WealthTracker — local edition core schema (SQLite)
-- Phase 1 design draft. NOT applied anywhere. NOT a migration.
-- ============================================================================
--
-- Source of truth for every rule reproduced here: supabase/migrations/*.sql.
-- packages/types/supabase.ts is NOT a source — it declares eight tables with no
-- migration behind them (mortgage_calculations, financial_plans,
-- saved_calculations, recurring_templates, tags, sync_queue, user_id_mappings,
-- audit_log — all verified: zero matching CREATE TABLE in supabase/migrations).
--
-- ── THE FOUR RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE ──────────────────────────────
--
-- 1. Money is INTEGER minor units. Never REAL. Every table is STRICT, so this
--    is enforced by the storage engine, not by convention:
--        sqlite> CREATE TABLE s(amt INTEGER NOT NULL) STRICT;
--        sqlite> INSERT INTO s VALUES (1.5);
--        Error: cannot store REAL value in INTEGER column s.amt
--    (verified, SQLite 3.54.0). Without STRICT, INTEGER is only an affinity and
--    a float sails straight in.
--
-- 2. Scale is per column, and the column NAME says which:
--        _minor  INTEGER, 1e2   money            (matches numeric(x,2) exactly)
--        _e8     INTEGER, 1e8   quantity, price  (numeric(20,8) / price fix)
--        _e10    INTEGER, 1e10  fx rate
--        _bp     INTEGER, 1e2   percentage, NOT money
--    A reader who cannot see the scale in the name will eventually get it wrong.
--
-- 3. Every money column carries a bounded CHECK, because SQLite integers are
--    int64 and the declared Postgres types are wider than int64 once scaled.
--    See "OVERFLOW ARITHMETIC" below.
--
-- 4. Foreign keys are only enforced when the connection says so.
--        sqlite> PRAGMA foreign_keys;   -->  0
--    (verified). Every ON DELETE SET NULL in this file — including the one that
--    deliberately strands a transfer's other leg — is inert unless the opening
--    code sets PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON. That PRAGMA belongs in the Rust
--    connection setup where no caller can forget it.
--
-- ── THE OWNERSHIP PAIRING (R-12 — new, and not one of DESIGN.md's 87) ───────
--
-- Every reference to an account carries the account's OWNER alongside its id,
-- and the target is `accounts (id, user_id)` rather than `accounts (id)`. Seven
-- keys, listed at their definitions:
--
--     transactions.account_id                 CASCADE
--     transactions.transfer_account_id        clear (see below)
--     transaction_splits.transfer_account_id  clear
--     accounts.parent_account_id              clear
--     categories.account_id                   CASCADE
--     goals.account_id                        clear
--     investments.account_id                  CASCADE
--
-- WHY, in the cloud's words
-- (20260808170000_rows_cannot_name_a_foreign_account.sql:27-42): row-level
-- security gates on user_id alone, referential-integrity checks are exempt from
-- row-level security by design, and so a single-column key answered "does this
-- account exist?" while nobody was left to answer "does it belong to the same
-- person as this row?". A row filed against a stranger's account is invisible
-- to that stranger and counted by every aggregate that reaches their data
-- through account_id.
--
-- A local file has ONE login and no RLS, so that particular attack is not the
-- local reason. The local reason is the harness: a differential harness whose
-- two schemas disagree about what a legal row is measures the schemas, not the
-- implementations. And a restore is a real path — a backup carrying a row whose
-- account belongs to a login that is not this one is exactly the shape this
-- refuses, and the shape a local edition WILL be handed (X-9, id remapping).
--
-- THE ANCHOR. SQLite, like Postgres, requires the parent columns of a composite
-- foreign key to be collectively UNIQUE. `accounts.id` is already the primary
-- key, so `(id, user_id)` could not have been non-unique — the index below
-- exists solely so that the pair is a legal foreign-key TARGET. Without it
-- every child insert fails with `foreign key mismatch - "transactions"
-- referencing "accounts"` (verified) rather than with anything about ownership.
--
-- THE ONE DIVERGENCE, IN MECHANISM AND NOT IN BEHAVIOUR. Four of the seven were
-- `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and the cloud keeps them so by naming the column:
-- `ON DELETE SET NULL (transfer_account_id)`, PostgreSQL 15+. **SQLite has no
-- such syntax and no such behaviour.** MEASURED (probe-composite-fk.mjs,
-- SQLite 3.50.0):
--
--     ON DELETE SET NULL (pid)   -> near "(": syntax error
--     ON DELETE SET NULL on a composite key, child user_id NULLABLE
--                                -> BOTH columns nulled: {uid: null, pid: null}
--     the same with user_id NOT NULL
--                                -> the parent DELETE is REFUSED:
--                                   "NOT NULL constraint failed: c2.uid"
--
-- So a bare SET NULL here would not merely null too much; it would make
-- "delete an account somebody transferred to" impossible — which is the exact
-- failure the cloud's guard 1 refuses to ship (20260808170000:274-287).
--
-- The four keys are therefore declared with SQLite's default action (NO ACTION,
-- checked immediately) and the clearing is done by `trg_unnest_account_
-- references`, a BEFORE DELETE trigger on accounts that nulls ONLY the account
-- column. Behaviour is identical, including the part nobody would think to
-- check: a native SQLite SET NULL fires the child's own triggers, so the
-- updated_at bump that the FK action used to cause still happens, from the
-- trigger's UPDATE instead. MEASURED both ways (probe-fk-triggers.mjs, cases A
-- and C: `updated_at = BUMPED` either way).
--
-- And the arrangement fails LOUD rather than quiet: if the trigger ever stopped
-- reaching a referencing row, the account DELETE would be refused by the key
-- instead of silently orphaning it.
--
-- ── OVERFLOW ARITHMETIC (this is why the bounds are what they are) ──────────
--
-- INT64_MAX = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 ≈ 9.223e18.
--
-- Postgres numeric(20,2) permits up to 1e18 − 0.01. Scaled by 100 that needs
-- 1e20, which int64 CANNOT hold. The same is true of numeric(20,8) scaled by
-- 1e8. The prior spike flagged this for quantity only; it is true of EVERY
-- numeric(20,x) column in the schema, money included.
--
-- SQLite's sum() over INTEGER raises "integer overflow" rather than silently
-- promoting to float (verified: SELECT sum(x) FROM (9223372036854775807, 1)
-- --> Error: integer overflow). Fail-loud is the behaviour we want, but the
-- bounds are chosen so it never fires on real data:
--
--   MONEY_ROW  = ±1e11 minor  = ±£1,000,000,000.00 per row
--                9.223e18 / 1e11 = 92,233,720 rows summable before overflow.
--   MONEY_STOCK= ±1e15 minor  = ±£10,000,000,000,000.00 per balance/target
--                9.223e18 / 1e15 = 9,223 accounts summable.
--   QTY        = ±9e18 raw at 1e8 = ±90,000,000,000 units, 8dp exact.
--                Postgres numeric(20,8) permits 1e12 units, so a position
--                larger than 9e10 units exists in the cloud type and is
--                REFUSED here. That divergence is deliberate and tested.

  -- the rule src/utils/transactionReconciliation.ts holds for the app and
  -- COALESCE(is_reconciled, is_cleared) holds in SQL. 0 means marked or not but
  -- explicitly NOT committed; 1 means committed by a finalize.
  --
  -- DEFAULT 0, and the cloud's own two-statement trick is BOTH unavailable here
  -- and unnecessary. The cloud added the column bare and then set the default,
  -- because a column added WITH one gives existing rows that default through
  -- attmissingval and would silently answer "not committed" for the whole of
  -- history. MEASURED (probe-addcolumn.mjs, node:sqlite 3.50.0): SQLite does
  -- exactly the same — after `ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN c INTEGER DEFAULT 0`, a
  -- row written BEFORE the alter reads 0 and not NULL, with no rewrite — and
  -- SQLite has no `ALTER COLUMN … SET DEFAULT` at all (`near "ALTER": syntax
  -- error`), so the two-step cannot be spelled. It is not needed: this file is
  -- CREATEd rather than migrated, so it has no pre-split rows of its own, and
  -- the default is what every INSERT that says nothing about the column gets —
  -- which is the cloud's answer too, and the migration's rule that "a
  -- transaction is born uncommitted whether it was typed, imported or
  -- downloaded". A bank-feed row still arrives is_cleared = 1; that is a mark.
  --
  -- WHERE A NULL CAN STILL ARRIVE: a restored cloud backup, whose rows carry
  -- NULL for the whole of a user's history. DISCHARGED 2026-08-11 by slice 25,
  -- which is the slice that could measure it — a round trip needs a collector,
  -- and until there was one nothing could produce the file this rule is about.
  --
  -- The obligation as recorded here anticipated the right FIX and the wrong
  -- RULE, and the difference is worth keeping. It said the fix was "one Kind in
  -- crate::backup that tells absent from null", with an absent key still taking
  -- the default. The differential spec (restore-a-deliberate-null-is-not-the-
  -- same-as-a-column-the-file-never-mentioned) measured that against the cloud
  -- and found it diverging: 0 here, NULL there. The cloud's own rule, from
  -- 20260811090000, fills a silence from the schema's default for exactly one
  -- class — NOT NULL columns with a constant default — so a NULLABLE column is
  -- never reached by it at all. `crate::backup` now says the same thing in one
  -- sentence: a column that may hold null is given what the file says, or NULL;
  -- a column that may not is given what the file says, or its default. So a

-- the command layer creates, and only for the life of one transaction.
--
--   BEGIN IMMEDIATE;
--   INSERT OR IGNORE INTO _rpc_guard VALUES ('split');
--   ... writes ...
--   DELETE FROM _rpc_guard WHERE flag = 'split';
--   COMMIT;
--
-- It must be a REAL table, not a TEMP one. VERIFIED: a persistent trigger
-- cannot reference temp objects —
--     Parse error: trigger trg_protect_split_is_split cannot reference
--                  objects in database temp
-- so the TEMP-table version of this design does not compile. The real table
-- is set and cleared inside the SAME transaction as the writes it authorises,
-- so a crash rolls the flag back with everything else; a stray row is
-- therefore impossible rather than merely unlikely, and verify_integrity()
-- reports one anyway.
--
-- HARDENING OPTION (not taken in Phase 1, recorded here): replace the table
-- with an application-defined SQL function `rpc_guard(flag)` registered by the
-- Rust layer. The file then stays READABLE by any tool while being WRITABLE
-- only by a process that supplies the function — the closest local analogue of
-- "only the RPC may write". Rejected for Phase 1 because it makes the
-- differential harness's SQLite driver depend on the Rust binary even for
-- setup fixtures.

--   * it SKIPS when the user has no Transfer type anchor yet. The cloud comment
--     explains it (categories seed lazily; a parentless category renders as
--     junk) and the RESTORE PATH DEPENDS ON IT: restore_user_chunk inserts
--     accounts first, when no categories exist, so this trigger stands itself
--     down and the backup's own To/From rows land unopposed. A local restore
--     must keep that order for the same reason.
--   * it is COLLISION-GUARDED. categories are UNIQUE (user_id, name, parent_id)
--     while account names are not unique, so two accounts of the same name
--     would collide. The cloud uses ON CONFLICT … DO NOTHING so account
--     creation survives the clash; SQLite spells it identically. NOT
--     `INSERT OR IGNORE`, which would swallow every other constraint too.
--
-- The id: the cloud column defaults to gen_random_uuid(); this schema has no
-- such default, so the trigger builds a v4 UUID from randomblob(). random() is

-- ── Suggestion dismissals die with their subject ───────────────────────────
-- Port of prune_suggestion_dismissals_for_transaction (20260806180000:156-170).
--
-- BEFORE, not AFTER — and the difference is the whole trigger. MEASURED
-- (slice 19): as an AFTER DELETE it never fired once. The cloud keeps the
-- subjects in a `text[]` ON the dismissal, so `subject_ids @> ARRAY[OLD.id]` is
-- still true whenever its trigger runs. This schema keeps them in a child table
-- with `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `transaction_id` (see the table, and the reason it
-- is a key rather than an array) — and SQLite applies that cascade before the
-- AFTER trigger, so by the time this statement looked for the subject rows they
-- had already gone with the transaction. The subquery matched nothing, the
-- dismissal survived, and nothing said a word.
--
-- What it costs is not a tidy-up: the dismissal is left naming a row that no
-- longer exists, with no subjects at all, and it travels into every backup taken
-- afterwards. `contract.ts`'s "forgets a refusal about a row that no longer
-- exists" is the rule that found it, and the rule says why the cloud does it
-- with a trigger and every other engine has to do it too.
--
-- BEFORE is safe: the DELETE below cascades the subject rows itself, the
-- transaction's own delete then finds nothing left to cascade, and a tidy-up
-- that runs a moment earlier cannot fail a financial delete any more than one
-- that runs a moment later.

-- ── R-12: clearing an account reference without clearing its owner ──────────
-- The SET NULL half of the ownership pairing, done by hand because SQLite will
-- not do it. Read "THE OWNERSHIP PAIRING" at the head of this file first; the
-- short version is that `ON DELETE SET NULL` on a composite key nulls EVERY
-- child key column, `user_id` is NOT NULL on all four of these tables, and
-- SQLite has no `ON DELETE SET NULL (column)` to name just the one. MEASURED:
-- a bare SET NULL turns "delete an account somebody transferred to" into
-- `NOT NULL constraint failed`.
--
-- So those four keys carry NO on-delete action — SQLite's default, NO ACTION,
-- checked immediately — and this trigger clears the references first. It runs
-- BEFORE the account row goes, which is the whole reason it works: by the time
-- the key is checked there is nothing left pointing at the row.
--
-- Each UPDATE names the owner as well as the account. That is redundant TODAY,
-- because the very keys this trigger serves guarantee a referencing row shares
-- the account's owner — and it is deliberate: if that guarantee were ever lost,
-- this trigger would leave the stray row behind and the account DELETE would be
-- REFUSED by the key rather than silently orphaning it. Loud, not quiet.
--
-- It lives here rather than beside the other triggers because a trigger body
-- may not name a table that does not exist yet, and `goals` is defined above
-- this line and below those.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: the three CASCADE keys (transactions.account_id,
-- categories.account_id, investments.account_id) are untouched — CASCADE needs
-- no column list, so the declaration still says it, and this trigger must not
-- pre-empt it. Deleting an account still takes its transactions (R-1), its
-- To/From category (C-3/C-5) and its holdings (R-9) exactly as before.
--
-- ── THE LINK CLEAR, AND WHY IT IS PART OF THE SAME TRIGGER ──────────────────
-- ADDED 2026-08-08, by the wipe port, which could not wipe. Two things that are
-- each individually right combine into a refusal the cloud does not have:
--
--   * `transactions_linked_has_target` — a LOCAL CHECK ("a linked transfer must
--     name the other account"). The cloud has no such constraint; the rule lives
--     procedurally inside its RPCs. MEASURED on the reference cluster: the only
--     CHECKs on public.transactions are the type enum, the provider enum and the
--     import-provenance pair.
--   * the two `transfer_account_id = NULL` statements above, which exist ONLY
--     because SQLite has no `ON DELETE SET NULL (column)`.
--
-- The trigger is BEFORE DELETE, so it nulls `transfer_account_id` while
-- `linked_transfer_id` is still set — a state that lasts one statement and that
-- the CHECK refuses. MEASURED, both engines, on a linked pair whose far side is
-- deleted:
--
--   postgres  ok       — 2 rows survive; the survivor reads transfer_account_id
--                        NULL, linked_transfer_id NULL
--   sqlite    REFUSED  — CHECK constraint failed: transactions_linked_has_target
--   sqlite    REFUSED  — the same, for a split leg:
--                        transaction_splits_linked_has_target
--
-- Postgres reaches BOTH nulls because the two are independent foreign-key
-- actions: `transfer_account_id` is SET NULL by the account key, and
-- `linked_transfer_id` is SET NULL by the transactions key when the counterpart
-- row — which lives IN the account being deleted — cascades away. It never sees
-- the half-nulled row because it never has to evaluate a constraint that would
-- object to one.
--
-- So the three UPDATEs below do the SAME work Postgres's own keys do, in the one
-- order that never produces a row the CHECK can object to: clear the LINKS whose
-- counterpart is about to cascade FIRST, then clear the targets. Note the
-- condition — a link is cleared only when the row (or split line) it names lives
-- in the account going away, which is exactly the set the cascade would have
-- nulled. A link pointing somewhere else is left alone.
--
-- The consequence if this is ever removed: `wipe_user_financial_data` — "delete
-- everything" — is REFUSED outright on any file containing one linked transfer,
-- which is every real file. The refusal names a CHECK about transfer targets
-- while the user is trying to erase the whole ledger, and there is no way
-- through it from the UI.
--
-- The verb still owes `_rpc_guard('leg')` on top of this: clearing a linked
-- leg's `linked_transfer_id` is an UPDATE of a watched column and
-- `trg_protect_linked_leg` raises `split_leg_locked` for it. MEASURED: with the
-- widened trigger and NO guard the split-leg case still refuses, and with the
-- guard it succeeds and the surviving line reads NULL/NULL. That is R-5 working
-- as designed, not a second defect — the guard is the caller's to hold.

-- ============================================================================
-- 8. CUSTOM REPORTS
-- ============================================================================
-- The twin of 20260812140000_reports_outlive_the_browser.sql, and the only table
-- in this file whose cloud original was written because the work it holds was
-- not being kept ANYWHERE.
--
-- `src/services/customReportService.ts` is a real builder: summary statistics,
-- line, pie and bar charts, tables, category breakdowns and period-over-period
-- comparisons, every one of them computed from the user's own transactions. It
-- then saved the result to `window.localStorage`, under one key, on one machine.
-- The cloud's header records what that cost somebody with two computers. It cost
-- the LOCAL edition strictly more, which is why this table is not optional here:
-- the desktop promise is that the FILE is everything, and a report composed in a
-- desktop window lived in the WebView's storage rather than in the ledger it
-- described. Copying the file to another machine did not bring it. Nothing
-- anywhere said so.
--
-- ── IT HOLDS NO MONEY, AND THAT IS A PROPERTY RATHER THAN AN OMISSION ────────
--
-- Every other table in this section has a `_minor` column and a bounded CHECK
-- around it. This one has neither and must never gain either. A custom report is
-- a QUESTION about the ledger — which components, over which range, narrowed to
-- which accounts — and the answer is computed fresh from `transactions` every
-- time it is generated. A stored figure here would be a cache of an answer the
-- ledger can change underneath, and the reports page would start disagreeing
-- with the register for reasons nobody could see. The rule is the same one R-1
-- keeps for balances, arriving through a door that has no money in it: two
-- numbers are only worth having while they are arrived at independently, and a
-- report is not a second number, it is a second QUESTION.
--
-- ── WHY `components` IS AN ARRAY AND `filters` IS AN OBJECT, BY CHECK ────────
--
-- Because every reader ITERATES the one and INDEXES INTO the other, and
-- `json_valid()` on its own does not say which: it accepts a bare number, a
-- quoted string and an object equally, so a `components` holding `{}` would pass
-- validity and render as no report at all — a blank page with no error on it.
-- `json_type()` is what turns that into a refusal at the write, where the person
-- who typed it is still looking.
--
-- The SHAPE INSIDE stays the client's business (`ReportComponent[]` and the
-- filter object in `src/components/CustomReportBuilder.tsx`), so a component can
-- gain a config key without a migration; what may not vary is the container.
--
-- Order inside `components` is MEANINGFUL — it is the order the blocks render
-- in, top to bottom — which is why the write verbs replace this column wholesale
-- rather than merging into it the way the goal verbs merge `metadata`. The
-- argument is at `crate::verbs::update_custom_report`, and it is the reason this
-- table's two blobs are not `metadata` under another name.
--
-- ── THE ROW IDS INSIDE `filters`, WHICH THIS TABLE DOES NOT CONSTRAIN ────────
--
-- `filters.accounts` and `filters.categories` hold account and category ids.
-- They are opaque JSON content to this file: no foreign key reaches them, there
-- is no R-12 ownership pairing to make (the table has no `account_id` COLUMN for
-- one to hang off), and `trg_unnest_account_references` deliberately has no
-- branch for this table — there is no column for it to null. Deleting an account
-- therefore leaves a report still naming it, and the report simply narrows to
-- nothing for that account. That is exactly what the cloud's jsonb does, and
-- reproducing the absence is the port.
--
-- What DOES rewrite those ids is the backup remapper on the TypeScript side
-- (`remapBackupIds`, declared through ENTITY_REFERENCES in
-- `src/services/backup/format.ts`), and it is the only thing that CAN: it is the
-- only place holding the map from the file's ids to the fresh ones a restore
-- mints. `crates/wealth-core/src/backup.rs` reproduces none of it on purpose —
-- "ids arrive already remapped, or they do not arrive remapped at all".

--     discovering: `jsonb` NORMALISES on the way in, losing key order and
--     whitespace, and TEXT does not. A report round-tripped through the two
--     engines is the same DOCUMENT and not the same BYTES.
--   * `uuid` and `timestamptz` there, TEXT here, and no `gen_random_uuid()`
--     default on the key — B-5, the same as `budgets.id` and `goals.id`: the id
--     is the caller's to mint or the verb's, never the column's.
--   * the cloud stamps `updated_at` from `update_custom_reports_updated_at`, a
--     BEFORE UPDATE trigger. There is no such trigger here, for the reason the
--     updated_at family in section 6 gives, so the verbs write the column
--     themselves.
--   * `custom_reports_definition_is_small` — 256 KiB over the two blobs — has NO
--     twin here, and the absence is a decision rather than an oversight. The
--     cloud's reason is bandwidth: a report that cached its own output would put
--     a second copy of the ledger into every boot's download. A local file
--     downloads nothing, so the same mistake costs disk instead of somebody's
--     morning, and a CHECK is the wrong instrument for it either way — it
--     refuses the save AFTER the report has been composed, which is the one
--     moment a person cannot act on the news. If it ever needs catching here,
--     `verify_integrity` (section 14) is where a local file keeps its "this is
--     odd" observations, at `severity = 'warning'`.
--   * RLS, the four owner policies and the anon revoke have no local twin at
--     all: one login, no PostgREST, and the file's owner can open it with any
--     SQLite tool (the point section 10 makes about the audit log). `user_id` is
--     still NOT NULL and still a foreign key, because a RESTORED file can hold
--     more than one login's rows.
--   * the cloud indexes `(user_id, updated_at DESC)` because its page lists
--     reports newest-first. This is the plain owner index every other table in
--     this file carries, because the local read orders by `created_at, id` —
--     this crate's own stated tie-break — and a covering index for a list of a
--     dozen rows is write cost bought against a sort of a dozen rows. The
--     argument, with the measurement behind it, is at `crate::verbs::reads`.


-- ============================================================================
-- 9. INVESTMENTS
-- ============================================================================
-- THE PRICE FIX. The cloud stores every unit price as numeric(10,2)
-- (initial-schema.sql:553, :575, :581) against quantities at numeric(20,8).
-- A share priced at £12.345 cannot be written; it rounds to £12.35 or £12.34
-- and the position value is wrong from that moment on. That is a pre-existing
-- schema bug, and this is a fresh schema, so it is fixed here:
--
--   prices are _e8 (8 decimal places), the same scale as quantity.
--
-- 8dp is chosen, not measured: it is exact for UK fund prices (4dp), US equity
-- (4dp), and sub-cent crypto down to £0.00000001. It is NOT enough for tokens
-- quoted below that, and the file records the scale in schema_meta so a later
-- widening is a migration rather than an archaeology exercise.
--
-- price_e8 * quantity_e8 is 1e16-scaled and overflows int64 for any position
-- over about £92. It is therefore NEVER computed in SQL. market_value_minor is
-- computed in the command layer in i128, rounded half-up to minor units, and
-- stored. cost_basis_minor likewise.

-- 12. SUGGESTION DISMISSALS
-- ============================================================================
-- The cloud stores subject_ids as uuid[] with a GIN index
-- (20260806180000:95, :109-110). SQLite has neither, so the array becomes a
-- child table — which is strictly better here: the prune trigger becomes an
-- indexed join instead of an array containment scan, and the "every id
-- resolves in exactly one table" property the column comment claims becomes a
-- foreign key instead of a promise.

CREATE TABLE suggestion_dismissals (
  id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  -- NINE, matching 20260817220000 — this list and the cloud CHECK must widen
  -- together, and the parity lane is what notices when they do not.
  --
  -- 20260806180000:99-100 created the constraint with four kinds;
  -- 20260808120000 added payee-merchant and payee-line, and 20260808190000
  -- added payee-hidden, both by DROP + ADD of the whole constraint. This mirror
  -- predated those two, and the gap was RECORDED rather than closed in three
  -- places (crate `row/dismissal.rs`, `mappers/rows.ts`'s DISMISSAL_KINDS, and
  -- the read spec's notes) because nothing that existed could reach it: a read
  -- returns what is stored, and a payee dismissal could not be stored.
  --
  -- It is closed HERE, by exactly the argument that closed
  -- `last_reconciled_balance_minor` above: `dismissSuggestion(kind:
  -- DismissalKind, …)` is the seam's own signature, `DismissalKind` names every
  -- kind, and a value the seam's own type carries that this file cannot hold
  -- is a write the local edition would have to refuse while the cloud accepts
  -- it. Settings → Payee cleanup drives all three of the payee kinds through
  -- that one door (PayeeCleanup.tsx:433, :449, :491), so the four-kind CHECK
  -- was not a theoretical gap — it was that whole screen refusing to save on a
  -- local file. The restore path is the second half: a cloud backup carrying
  -- one payee dismissal would have been refused WHOLE, which is
  -- `restore_user_chunk`'s all-or-nothing rule doing exactly what it says.
  --
  -- The payee kinds are the same table and the same policies with two habits of
  -- their own, both of which this schema already supports without a change:
  -- `subject_key` holds ROLE-TAGGED, PERCENT-ENCODED PAYEE TEXT rather than ids
  -- (so a restore's id remapping cannot rewrite a payee name), and subject_ids
  -- is EMPTY — which is why the prune trigger below never removes one. That
  -- emptiness is correct rather than untidy: delete every transaction carrying
  -- the wording, re-import the statement, and the same wording arrives on brand
  -- new ids, so a refusal that expired with the rows would put the payee the
  -- user struck off straight back on the screen (20260808190000:57-61).
  --
  -- The two RECURRING kinds (20260817220000) answer "is this detected pattern
  -- a real commitment?" — recurring-confirmed is the first POSITIVE verdict
  -- stored here, the gate that lets a pattern feed the calendar and forecast;
  -- recurring-not moves it to a recoverable band. Same two habits as the
  -- payee kinds: no subject rows (a pattern outlives its rows), and a key
  -- whose payee text no id remapper can touch — with one role-prefixed
  -- ACCOUNT id segment that a restore's remapping rewrites in place, so the
  -- verdict follows the account into its new login.

-- Mirrors supabase/migrations/20260809160000_preferences_that_travel.sql. One

-- the account rather than to the browser.
--
-- Differences from the cloud, both forced by SQLite and neither a change of
-- meaning:
--   * jsonb has no local equivalent, so the document is TEXT guarded by
--     json_valid() plus json_type() = 'object' — the pair that reproduces the
--     cloud's jsonb-plus-jsonb_typeof check. A caller must not be able to store
--     an array here; every reader indexes into it by key.
--   * the cloud's size ceiling is `length(prefs::text) <= 262144`; length() over
--     the TEXT is literally the same measurement, so the number is carried
--     across unchanged rather than re-derived.
--
-- Account ids DO appear inside the document (dashboardKeyAccounts, the archive
-- overrides map). They are deliberately NOT foreign keys and cannot be: they sit
-- inside JSON, one level below anything a key can address. Nothing depends on
-- them resolving — a pinned account that no longer exists is skipped by the
-- dashboard, exactly as it is today — and the restore rewrites them through the
-- same id map every other reference goes through (see
-- backupService.remapPreferenceIds). That is the only mechanism available and
-- the only one needed; a preference is not a ledger entry.
-- Both CHECKs are NAMED, and the names are the cloud's own (amendment 9). An
-- anonymous CHECK is reported by SQLite as `CHECK constraint failed:` and the
-- expression, and by Postgres as the constraint's name — so a differential spec
-- asserting one refusal had to assert two different strings and would have gone
-- on passing if either engine started refusing for a different reason.
--
-- NOT a trigger, and NOT an `updated_at` stamp. `user_preferences` has no
-- triggers at all: the four ported above are the four the write paths could not
-- do for themselves, and the preferences verb writes its own stamp exactly as
-- the planning family's do.

-- 14. verify_integrity() — the invariants no constraint can hold
-- ============================================================================
-- One view per whole-database invariant, plus one union that reports every
-- violation with a name. The Rust command runs it after every write in debug
-- and test builds, and on demand ("Check this file") in release. It is the
-- single highest-leverage artifact in the local core: every procedural
-- invariant that a future code path might drop is caught here.
--
-- CORRECTED 2026-08-08. This comment used to say *"each of these has a Postgres
-- twin, textually different but semantically identical, so the differential
-- harness can compare violation NAMES across engines"*. It does not. TRACED:
-- `grep -rn verify_integrity` over `supabase/`, `api/` and `src/` returns
-- nothing but this file and its own specs; there is no `CREATE VIEW` anywhere in
-- `supabase/migrations/`; and the only Postgres relatives of any of these are two
-- one-off verification SELECTs a migration runs once and discards
-- (20260808090000:292-299 and 20260807200000:100-110, both of B-1 alone). So
-- verify_integrity is a LOCAL-ONLY facility with no differential oracle, and the
-- specs that prove it say so — `crates/wealth-core/src/verbs/verify_integrity.rs`
-- carries the whole argument.
--
-- Two columns beyond the original three, added 2026-08-08 with the two ingest
-- checks (PHASE1-PLAN §2.5):
--
--   entity    which table the subject lives in, so a caller can resolve the id
--             without knowing every check by name
--   severity  'violation' (a rule of the ledger is broken) or 'warning' (a
--             HEURISTIC — see the two ingest checks at the foot). v_integrity_ok
--             counts only 'violation', so adding advisory checks cannot make the

-- ── The two INGEST checks (PHASE1-PLAN §2.5) ────────────────────────────────
--
-- Everything above catches a ledger that contradicts itself. Neither of the two
-- commonest ingest disasters does that: a card statement imported with inverted
-- signs, and an <AVAILBAL> stored where a <LEDGERBAL> belongs, both produce data
-- that is internally consistent and entirely wrong. MEASURED before these were
-- written (`scratchpad/local-core/probe-integrity1.mjs`, cases 16 and 17): both
-- shapes were planted and the fifteen checks above reported NOTHING.
--
-- They are HEURISTICS and are labelled as such: a credit card genuinely can be
-- in credit, and a bank figure genuinely can disagree with an unreconciled
-- ledger. They report `severity = 'warning'`, v_integrity_ok ignores warnings,
-- and the app is expected to phrase them as a question rather than a verdict.
--
-- Both are narrowed to `type = 'credit'` deliberately. That is the whole card
-- population — accounts_type_check has no 'card' — and it is the only kind where
-- "positive means you are owed money" is the wrong reading. A loan or a mortgage
-- carries the same sign convention but is never fed by a statement importer
-- making this decision per row, so widening them would buy false positives
-- without buying a catch.

UNION ALL
  -- TS-F1/TS-F2. A card's stored balance is -current; a positive one means
  -- either a genuine credit balance or an importer that got the sign backwards.
  -- The provenance test is what makes it worth reporting: a hand-typed positive
  -- balance is a decision, an imported one is a guess.

  -- without sign(): SQLite's sign() needs SQLITE_ENABLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS, and
  -- `bank_balance_minor * balance_minor < 0` would overflow int64 at the bounded
  -- extremes and silently become a float. Two comparisons say the same thing
