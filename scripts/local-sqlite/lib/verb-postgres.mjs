// psql driven directly because the shell harness's grep-the-output shape cannot
// report accepted-vs-refused per statement.

// ── The reads, whose oracle is a QUERY and not a function ────────────────────
//
// Every other verb in this file names a Postgres function. The nine list reads
// cannot: the cloud reads these tables over PostgREST, so the thing being ported
// is the query the client BUILDS — its `.eq()`s and its `.order()` — and the
// oracle has to be that query written out. Each entry in the READS table below
// names the TypeScript it is transcribed from, and the transcription is
// deliberately literal: same filter, same ORDER BY, same column list.
//
// They live in a TABLE rather than one query per verb because `load_boot` asks
// six of them at once. Two copies of the transactions query — one for the read
// and one for the composite — would be two queries that agree until somebody
// edits the one they happened to find.
//
// This is the same hazard `merge_categories` above declares, and it has the same
// answer: a query repeated in the harness can silently agree with a wrong
// implementation, so what makes it safe is that a disagreement is LOUD. The two
// sides are compared element by element and key by key, and the array's ORDER is
// part of what is compared (`stableJson` sorts object keys and never arrays).
//
// THE TIE-BREAK IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT HERE. The Rust side orders by `…, id`
// behind the cloud's key, states in its own module docs that the second key is
// not a port of anything, and is proved by a single-engine spec. Copying it into
// this oracle would make the harness agree with the port about a thing the cloud
// never said. So these queries carry exactly the client's ORDER BY, and every
// spec that compares them uses a fixture whose sort key is distinct.
//
// ONE READ IS AN EXCEPTION AND IT IS WRITTEN IN: `list_transactions` orders by
// `date DESC, id DESC`, and the second key is the CLOUD's — the client states it
// and calls it, in its own comment, a "stable tiebreak for paging". Fifty-two
// pages of an unstably-ordered query hand the same row over twice and lose
// another, so the cloud had to settle what the other reads could leave open.
// Leaving it out here would be the harness pretending the cloud is vaguer than
// it is.
//
// AND ONE VERB IS NOT A QUERY AT ALL: `account_balances` IS a Postgres function,
// so its oracle is that function, called for real — see its entry below for how
// the identity it takes from a JWT is supplied.
//
// AND ONE IS NOT A QUERY EITHER, THE OTHER WAY ROUND: `load_boot`'s cloud side
// is a TypeScript method, `DataServiceImpl.loadBoot`, whose body is six of these
// reads in the order the boot depended on. Its oracle is therefore those same
// six entries, gathered into one object — see its entry for what the cloud's
// snapshot carries that no database can answer with.

 * The RPC each verb maps onto, and how its result is projected.

 * `(p_id, p_user_id)` — and there is exactly one honest way to keep the "one
 * payload, both engines" rule while calling them: unpack the same object here.
 * The Rust command structs have the same three (and two) fields for the same
 * reason, so neither engine is handed a shape the other never saw.
 *
 * `COALESCE(… ->'patch', '{}')` because an absent patch is an empty patch on
 * both sides; `NULLIF(… ->>'user_id','')` because an absent owner is SQL NULL,
 * which is what makes `p_user_id IS NULL OR user_id = p_user_id` stand down.
 *
 * THE SPLIT WRITER IS PROJECTED, NOT RETURNED
 * -------------------------------------------
 * `set_transaction_splits_with_legs` returns `{is_split, split_count, amount,
 * counterparts}` and no transaction row, so there is nothing for the runner's
 * field-by-field row comparison to bite on. It is therefore PERFORMed and the
 * split PARENT is projected afterwards, through the same `ROW_JSON` every other
 * verb uses. That is not a translation of the result — the parent is a row both
 * engines store, read from storage on both sides after the call — and everything
 * the RPC's own return value carries (the line set, the counterparts, the
 * balances they moved) is asserted through `state` SELECTs written per engine,
 * which is where cross-engine comparisons of *rows* belong.
 *
 * `p_splits` is passed with `->` and NOT coalesced: an absent key must arrive as
 * SQL NULL so that the RPC's first refusal — "p_splits must be a jsonb array" —
 * is reachable from a payload rather than smoothed over by the driver.
 *
 * THE TRANSFER FAMILY IS PROJECTED TOO, AND WHICH ROW IS PART OF THE CONTRACT
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * All five return jsonb objects (or, for clear_transfer_links, a bare integer),
 * so like the split writer they are PERFORMed and one row is projected
 * afterwards through the same ROW_JSON. The row picked is the one the Rust side
 * returns under its own `transaction` key, so the two engines are compared on
 * the same row rather than on whichever each found convenient:
 *
 *   link_transfer_pair            id_a            (the RPC's `a`)
 *   create_transfer_counterpart   id              (the RPC's `source`)
 *   clear_transfer_links          ids[0]          (the first row NAMED)
 *   repair_claimed_transfer       stranded_id     (the RPC's `stranded`)
 *   link_split_line_transfer      transaction_id  (the RPC's `transaction`)
 *
 * Everything the projection cannot carry — the other side, the minted
 * counterpart, the line set, the balances, the unlink count — is asserted
 * through `state` SELECTs written per engine, which is where cross-engine
 * comparisons of rows belong.

 * `p_ids` is rebuilt as a real uuid[] rather than passed as jsonb: the RPC's
 * signature takes an array and the whole point of its first two guarantees
 * (all-or-nothing, DISTINCT) is array-shaped. A NULL `ids` and an absent one
 * both arrive as the empty array, which the RPC treats identically to NULL

  // ── THE RECONCILIATION AND ARCHIVE FAMILY ──────────────────────────────────
  //
  // Five RPCs, and they split two ways in how they are compared:
  //
  //   * the two `set_transactions_*` return a bare integer and DO change a
  //     transaction, so they are PERFORMed and the row the caller named first is
  //     projected — the clear_transfer_links shape, and the projected row is
  //     `ids[0]` for the same reason: it is the row the Rust side answers with
  //     under its own `transaction` key;
  //   * the other three return jsonb objects of their own, so like the restore
  //     family they are compared on that object and everything it cannot carry
  //     (which rows moved, what the account now records, the audit trail) is
  //     asserted through `state` SELECTs.
  //
  // `finalize_reconciliation` is the one whose ANSWER is not passed through
  // verbatim: its `ending_balance` comes back as a jsonb number from
  // `jsonb_build_object('ending_balance', p_ending_balance)`, and money crosses
  // this boundary as a decimal STRING on the Rust side. `::text` on the numeric
  // is exact and involves no rounding function, so the two agree without either
  // going through a float — the same rule ROW_JSON follows for `amount`.
  //
  // THE RE-RENDER IS A SECOND STATEMENT, AND IT HAS TO BE. The first draft
  // wrapped the call — `jsonb_set(finalize_reconciliation(…), '{ending_balance}',
  // to_jsonb(<the payload's figure>::text))` — and the spec for an absent ending
  // balance came back `ok` from a function whose first act is to raise. MEASURED
  // in psql: `jsonb_set` is STRICT, so when one of its arguments is NULL
  // Postgres skips evaluating the others and NEVER CALLS the RPC at all. A
  // wrapper that can stop the function under test from running is a driver that
  // reports on a call that did not happen, which is the worst thing this harness
  // could do. So the RPC is called on its own line, and the figure is re-rendered
  // out of ITS OWN answer afterwards.
  //
  // `p_ending_balance` is passed with `->>` and NULLIF'd, deliberately: an
  // absent key must arrive as SQL NULL so the RPC's first refusal —
  // `ending_balance_required` — stays reachable from a payload.

  // ── THE ACCOUNT FAMILY, WHOSE ORACLE IS A TYPESCRIPT WRITER ────────────────
  //
  // Three verbs that port no function, because `accounts` is one of the tables
  // the cloud writes DIRECTLY over PostgREST (PHASE3-PLAN D-2). So the oracle is
  // the WRITE the client builds, transcribed here key for key and default for
  // default — the same rule the READS table follows for a `.select()`, applied
  // to an `.insert()` and an `.update()`.
  //
  // Each is PERFORMed and the row projected afterwards through ACCOUNT_JSON, the
  // same twenty-six keys `crate::row::account::ListedAccount` serialises, so the
  // two engines are compared on the whole stored account rather than on whatever
  // each writer happened to return.
  //
  // WHAT IS TRANSCRIBED IS THE WRITER, NOT A TIDIED VERSION OF IT. Three of its
  // habits look like omissions and are reproduced anyway, because a spec that
  // finds one is finding a real difference between the editions:
  //
  //   * the create does NOT send `low_balance_alert_enabled` or
  //     `low_balance_threshold` — the columns exist in both engines and the
  //     CLIENT leaves them out, so an account created in the cloud with an alert
  //     configured arrives with the alert off;
  //   * the create sends `icon` and `color` as explicit NULLs, which is what
  //     `accountService.ts:260-261` does and is indistinguishable from the
  //     column default;
  //   * the update will happily send `balance`, which makes it an absolute
  //     balance setter. The verb refuses that by name; this does not.
  //
  // THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT LITERAL, and why. The writer's two money lines are
  // `balance: account.balance || 0` and
  // `initial_balance: account.openingBalance || account.balance || 0`, so it
  // takes TWO figures where the verb takes one. The payload a spec sends is a
  // WIRE payload with one money key, and it is mapped to both — which is exactly
  // what the writer is handed in production, because
  // `AppContextSupabase.addAccount:894-897` sets `balance = initialBalance ||
  // balance || 0` before the seam is called. Transcribing the writer means
  // transcribing what it is actually given. The case where a CALLER contradicts
  // itself is a seam-level difference and is declared where the seam can see
  // it — contract.ts's ACCOUNT_BALANCE_AT_BIRTH — rather than smuggled in here.
  //
  // `id` is supplied by the payload where the client leaves the column default
  // to answer, for the reason every write spec needs: two engines cannot be
  // compared on a row neither can name.

  // Transcribing the METHOD rather than the RPC is what makes the comparison
  // honest. The verb is one crossing where the client makes two — a device has no

  // (PHASE3-PLAN D-3) — so an oracle that only ran the RPC would report

  //
  // THE IDS DIVERGE BY DESIGN. Pass 1 of the RPC mints a fresh uuid for every

/**
 * Run the RPC inside a plpgsql block that CATCHES its exception.
 *
 * Without this, `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` aborts the script the moment the RPC refuses
 * and the state assertions never run — so a refusal could only ever be checked
 * on the SQLite side, and "the refusal rolled everything back" would be
 * asserted on one engine and assumed on the other. The block's implicit
 * savepoint undoes the RPC's partial effects exactly as a rolled-back request
 * would, so what the assertions then see is the same state a refused call leaves
 * behind in production.
 *
 * `WHEN assert_failure OR OTHERS` rather than `WHEN OTHERS`, and it took a
 * harness error to find out why. **`WHEN OTHERS` does not catch
 * `assert_failure`** — one of the two conditions Postgres documents as outside
 * it (the other is `query_canceled`) — and `assert_failure` IS `ERRCODE P0004`,
 * which is what `migrate_categories_atomic` raises BOTH of its named refusals
 * with (`20260724100000:69`, `:76`): `categories_payload_empty` and
 * `category_missing_id`. MEASURED here, 2026-08-11: the exception walked
 * straight past a `WHEN OTHERS` handler and aborted the script.
 *
 * That is a fact about the live RPC and not about this harness. Nothing in the
 * app wraps it in a handler today, so the app is unaffected — PostgREST reports
 * an error either way — but any Postgres function that ever calls it and expects
 * to be able to recover would abort instead, silently, on the two cases most
 * worth recovering from. Recorded here because this is the file that found it.
