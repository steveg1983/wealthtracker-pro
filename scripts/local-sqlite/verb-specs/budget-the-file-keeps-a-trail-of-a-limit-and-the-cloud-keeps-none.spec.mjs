// divergences is how a real one gets missed".
//
// PHASE1-PLAN §2.2 traced U-1 ("every financial write emits an audit row")
// against planningService and found it FALSE of budgets.amount, budgets.spent,
// goals.target_amount and goals.current_amount, then ruled that the local
// edition fixes it. This is the spec that holds the ruling: three writes, three
// entries here, and the cloud's log empty afterwards.
