// MEASURED, 2026-08-11, and it is not what this spec was first written to
// expect: `numeric(5,2)` does not REFUSE 80.005, it ROUNDS it to 80.01 — five
// significant digits with two after the point is a scale, not a validation. So
// the cloud stores a percentage nobody typed and says nothing, and the crate
// refuses the value by name before the file is opened. That is the same
// difference M-1 declares for money, on the one column in this family that is
// not money, and it is the reason the grammar is shared even though the type is
// not.
