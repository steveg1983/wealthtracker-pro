  design: 'BootSnapshot { accounts, categories, transactions, splits, budgets, goals } — the six awaits the boot effect used to make, moved behind the seam so the rules between them are the implementation\'s rather than one call site\'s. The cloud answers it with six crossings in that order; a file answers it from one transaction, which is the BOOT_COMPOSITION table\'s local-core row',
  consequence: 'an engine that answered a partial snapshot would leave the app deciding which of its own pages to open empty, and it would do it silently — no page reports "my list was not in the boot", it just draws nothing. Every list here is a page: the accounts sidebar, the register\'s category column, the register, split-aware reporting, the budgets page and the goals page',

  // `updated_at`, so the two pinning fragments come after the things they pin.
