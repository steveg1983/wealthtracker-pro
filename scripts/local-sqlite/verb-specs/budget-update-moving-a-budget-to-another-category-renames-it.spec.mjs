// So an edit that only moves the category also REWRITES THE NAME. Nobody would
// choose that; it is what falls out of a mapper filling in a NOT NULL column,
// and it is pinned here because a port that tidied it would leave the two
// editions disagreeing about what a budget is called after an ordinary edit.
