  title: 'a threshold stored as 4250 basis points arrives as "42.50" — the same text the cloud\'s numeric(5,2) casts to',
  design: 'schema.sql shouts NOT MONEY at this column and stores hundredths of a percent (8000 = 80.00%) because the file keeps every fractional quantity out of floating point; the cloud stores numeric(5,2). Two encodings, one value, and money.rs renders the local one — because the alternative is a `/ 100` on the far side of the boundary, which is exactly the shape R-7\'s grep exists to catch',
  consequence: 'get it wrong by a factor of a hundred and every budget alerts at 0.8% of its limit — on the first pound spent, for ever, on every budget in the file',
  parity: 'divergent',
  reason: 'THE STORED VALUES DIVERGE AND THE ANSWERS DO NOT, which is the whole spec. The state assertion reads what each file HOLDS — 4250 against 42.50 — while the result assertion reads what each engine ANSWERS with, and that is "42.50" on both. If the storage encodings ever stop diverging (a local column holding a percentage), this spec must go red and be re-thought rather than quietly keep passing.',
