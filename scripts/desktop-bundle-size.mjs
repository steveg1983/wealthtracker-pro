/**
 * THE DESKTOP RENDERER'S SIZE RATCHET.
 *
 *   npm run bundle:check:desktop     (build first: npm run desktop:ui)
 *
 * `scripts/bundle-size-check.mjs` does this for the web build. This is the same
 * instrument with the same shape — budgets as constants, a measured baseline
 * recorded beside them, an env override for experiments, non-zero exit when a
 * budget is passed — pointed at `apps/desktop/dist` and answering to different
 * numbers, for a different reason.
 *
 * ── WHY RAW BYTES ARE THE GATE HERE, AND GZIP IS NOT THE HEADLINE ───────────
 *
 * The web gate measures gzip because gzip is what a browser downloads: it is
 * the number a person waits for. NOTHING IS DOWNLOADED HERE. `tauri.conf.json`
 * names `apps/desktop/dist` as `frontendDist` and `tauri::generate_context!`
 * embeds those files into the binary at compile time, so the bytes this build
 * emits are bytes on the user's disk and bytes the WebView parses when the
 * window opens. Compression never enters it.
 *
 * So RAW is the number with a consequence and it is the one that fails a build.
 * Gzip is measured and budgeted anyway, two reasons: `apps/desktop/README.md`
 * has been quoting a gzip figure since slice 29 and a quoted number nobody runs
 * is a number that decays, and it is the only figure directly comparable with
 * the web bundle's — the two editions ship the same components eventually, and
 * the day that comparison matters it should not have to be re-derived.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS ACTUALLY GUARDING AGAINST, AND WHAT IT HAS ALREADY SEEN ────
 *
 * One specific future event, and it happened one slice after this file was
 * written. Slice 30's note said:
 *
 * > The renderer is 259 KiB today because it mounts a chooser and a ledger
 * > screen. … When the app's screens are mounted in the window — the next
 * > programme of work — they arrive through that graph, and they arrive all at
 * > once.
 *
 * They did. The mount slice's second half took the renderer from 259.3 KiB to
 * **3,273.1 KiB raw** — 12.6x — in one commit, and every byte of it was
 * intended. That is exactly the event this file exists to make somebody look at
 * rather than discover, and looking at it is what produced the note below.
 *
 * `desktop:greps` catches the part of an arrival which is a broken promise (a
 * Supabase client, browser storage, Clerk). It cannot catch the part which is
 * merely enormous: a renderer that doubled in size while staying perfectly
 * cloud-free passes every other check in this repository.
 *
 * ── IT REFUSES RATHER THAN SKIPS ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No build, no answer, non-zero exit — the same ruling `desktop:greps` and the
 * local contract suite already carry (R-8). A size gate that passes because it
 * measured an empty directory is a gate that reports green on a failed build.
 *
 * ── THE BINARY IS RECORDED AND NEVER GATED ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The 16 MB figure in `apps/desktop/README.md` was measured by hand once. This
 * prints it when there is a binary to read, so it stops being a claim. It is
 * NOT a budget, and must not become one here, because its size is a function of
 * the toolchain, the platform and the profile: CI's Linux binary and a
 * developer's arm64 macOS binary are different artefacts and neither is the
 * other's regression. A binary budget belongs to a release job that builds one
 * target, not to a check that runs wherever it is run.

 * BASELINE, re-measured 2026-08-12 at the mount slice's second half, on
 * `npm run desktop:ui`. 101 files; the ten that matter:
 *
 *   xlsx-*.js                     488.0 KiB raw   158.9 KiB gzip
 *   jspdf.es.min-*.js             377.0 KiB       123.1 KiB
 *   MountedLedger-*.js            306.3 KiB        90.9 KiB
 *   CategoricalChart-*.js         274.0 KiB        84.2 KiB   (recharts)
 *   index-*.js                    231.1 KiB        76.1 KiB   (React, the router, the entry)
 *   html2canvas.esm-*.js          196.7 KiB        46.1 KiB
 *   index.es-*.js                 154.9 KiB        51.5 KiB
 *   EditTransactionModal-*.js     120.3 KiB        33.5 KiB
 *   AccountTransactions-*.js       91.0 KiB        27.1 KiB
 *   Categories-*.js                89.1 KiB        27.9 KiB
 *   …and 91 more
 *   ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   total                       3,273.1 KiB     1,006.5 KiB
 *
 * THE PREVIOUS BASELINE WAS 259.3 KiB RAW / 86.7 KiB GZIP, and it was a window
 * that mounted a file chooser. This one is the application: 348 modules from the
 * entry, thirty-six routes, every page the web app serves except three that are
 * named and owed. The multiple is 12.6x and it is not a regression — there was
 * nothing here before.
 *
 * ── WHY THE NEW BUDGETS ARE WHERE THEY ARE ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ~10% above measured, which is the convention this file already had, and the
 * convention matters more than the number: it is tight enough that the NEXT
 * accidental arrival fails, which is the only job a ratchet has.
 *
 * ── WHAT SHOULD MAKE IT SMALLER, IN ORDER, AND WHY NOT IN THIS SLICE ────────
 *
 * The four biggest chunks are 1,335 KiB — 41% of the renderer — and not one of
 * them is this edition's own code:
 *
 *   xlsx + jspdf + html2canvas   1,062 KiB. Excel and PDF export. All three are
 *                                already lazy, all three are reachable from the
 *                                Export page, and `docs/bundle-optimization-plan
 *                                .md` has had them on the WEB app's list for
 *                                months. Whatever fixes them there fixes them
 *                                here, and doing it here first would be fixing
 *                                the smaller of two identical problems.
 *   recharts                     274 KiB, and the repo's own audit note says the
 *                                web build ships recharts AND chart.js. Picking
 *                                one is a design decision about every chart in
 *                                the product, not a desktop packaging chore.
 *
 * So: measured, recorded, budgeted, and pointed at the slice that should
 * actually do it. Lower these the day one of those lands. Raising them further
 * is allowed and is a decision that belongs in a commit message — not a number
 * quietly nudged until the build goes green.
 *
 * ── RAISED AT SLICE 31, AND WHAT FOR ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 3273.1 → 3924.1 KiB raw, 1006.5 → 1211.2 KiB gzip. That is +651 KiB raw and
 * +205 KiB gzip, and it is THREE WHOLE ROUTES arriving rather than a module
 * turning up by accident — which is the distinction this ratchet exists to draw,
 * so the growth is named here rather than absorbed:
 *
 *   `investments`      the portfolio page and its charts, which the router
 *                      could not mount until holdings went through the seam.
 *   `enhanced-import`  the CSV wizard, and `xlsx` with it — a spreadsheet
 *                      writer this bundle already carried for the Export page,
 *                      now also read by the import side.
 *   `data`             settings ▸ Data, which is where the delete-everything
 *                      button and the restore dialog live.
 *
 * `src/desktop/routes.ts`'s `AWAITING_THE_MOUNT` is now EMPTY, so this is the
 * last increase of this shape there can be: every address the web app serves has
 * a desktop answer, and the next raise would have to be a page that did not
 * exist before.
 *
 * The four biggest chunks are STILL not this edition's own code and the
 * paragraph above still applies unchanged — xlsx, jspdf, html2canvas and
 * recharts are 1,335 KiB of the 3,924, and the slice that fixes them is the
 * web app's.
 *
 * ── RE-RECORDED AFTER THE DESIGN PASS AND THE FX FEATURE ────────────────────
 *
 * 3924.1 → 4070.0 KiB raw, 1211.2 → 1240.6 KiB gzip, measured on a pristine
 * checkout of a2eec741 (#254). +145.9 raw over two merges, and the whole step
 * decomposes with no unexplained remainder — each part was measured by the
 * change that made it, at the time it was made:
 *
 *   #253 (design batches 3–6)   ~125 KiB. The design pass's own components —
 *                               PeriodBar, NetWorthSummary, the skeleton/
 *                               filtered-empty patterns, the register's new
 *                               chrome, the de-carded gallery — plus the token
 *                               sheet's growth in the shared stylesheet.
 *   #254 (cross-currency FX)    ~20 KiB. The rate dialog, the fx arithmetic,
 *                               the cross-currency matchers and the provenance
 *                               line under converted totals.
 *
 * Neither is an accidental arrival; both wear the tokens and both passed the
 * cloud greps on the day. The baseline had simply fallen two merges behind the
 * renderer it describes, which turned the drift figure into a ~146 KiB head
 * start for whatever came next — the exact blindness this file exists to
 * prevent. Budgets unchanged: 4320/1335 now sit ~6–8% above measured, tighter
 * than the ~10% convention, which is the right side to err on.
 *
 * One correction to the standing analysis above: chart.js is GONE — the web
 * bundle work of 2026-08-12 confirmed recharts is the product's only charting
 * library, so "recharts AND chart.js" is history and the recharts 274 KiB is
 * no longer waiting on a consolidation decision, only on a lazy-loading one.
 *
 * ── LOWERED 2026-09-01: THE SPREADSHEET WRITER IS GONE ──────────────────────
 *
 * The first entry here that goes DOWN, and the paragraph above finally has an
 * answer: *"xlsx + jspdf + html2canvas … `docs/bundle-optimization-plan.md` has
 * had them on the WEB app's list for months. Whatever fixes them there fixes
 * them here."* Nothing fixed them there. What happened instead is that the
 * owner ruled the two editions need not offer the same formats —
 *
 *     "Lose excel is fine as long as they can keep csv."   (1 Sep 2026)
 *
 * — so the desktop edition offers CSV and PDF and no .xlsx, and
 * `@spreadsheet` (a build-time alias, `src/editions/spreadsheet.ts`) makes that
 * true of the BUNDLE rather than only of the buttons. A runtime `if` would have
 * removed the button and kept the library: Vite splits `await import('xlsx')`
 * into a chunk whatever surrounds it, and a chunk is not deferred here — it is
 * embedded in the binary by `generate_context!` and sits on the disk of somebody
 * who never presses the button.
 *
 *   measured, 4a95a763 + the eviction, `npm run desktop:ui`:
 *
 *     before   4289.1 KiB raw   1326.2 KiB gzip   (187 + 2 files)
 *     after    3790.5 KiB raw   1163.8 KiB gzip   (187 files)
 *     shed     −498.6 KiB raw   −162.4 KiB gzip   — 11.6% of the renderer
 *
 * Two chunks left: `xlsx-*.js` (488.0 KiB raw / 159.2 gzip, the largest in the
 * bundle by 124 KiB) and `ExcelExport-*.js`, the modal that was its only
 * dedicated caller. `jspdf` is now the largest chunk and it STAYS — PDF is a
 * format this edition keeps.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE `before` FIGURE IS NOT THE BASELINE ABOVE ───────────────────
 *
 * Because the baseline had fallen behind again. 4070.0 → 4289.1 raw and 1240.6
 * → 1326.2 gzip is +219.1 / +85.6 of ordinary merged work since #254 — which had
 * quietly eaten seven eighths of the headroom, leaving the ratchet 30.9 KiB from
 * failing on whatever landed next. That is the exact blindness the re-record of
 * 2026-08-12 was written to prevent, happening again, which is worth saying out
 * loud: this file's baseline is only useful if it is re-measured on the day the
 * budgets move.
 *
 * ── WHY THE NEW BUDGETS ARE WHERE THEY ARE, AND THAT THEY ARE TIGHT ─────────
 *
 * 3830 / 1176: measured + 39.5 KiB raw (+1.04%) and + 12.2 KiB gzip (+1.05%),
 * which is the headroom that ACTUALLY existed the day before this change (30.9
 * KiB raw, 8.8 KiB gzip), preserved rather than the ~6–10% the paragraphs above
 * quote. The reason is the whole point of a ratchet: shedding 498.6 KiB and
 * leaving the budget at 4320 would have banked the win as 529 KiB of silent
 * permission for the next arrival, and a gate that has to be argued out of
 * permission it never granted is not a gate.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate and should surprise nobody: the next intended
 * growth of any size FAILS THIS CHECK, and the person who intended it raises
 * these two numbers in the commit that causes it and says what for — exactly as
 * slice 31 did for three routes and as #253/#254 should have. That is the
 * difference between a ratchet and a number that drifts, and it is cheap: it
 * costs one line in a commit that was going to be written anyway.
