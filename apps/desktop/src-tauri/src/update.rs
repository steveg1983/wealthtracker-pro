//! Self-update — asking, never assuming.
//!
//! # Why this is in Rust and not the renderer
//!
//! The same sentence `document.rs` opens with: the WebView is not the part of
//! this program that should be able to replace the program. An update is the
//! most privileged thing this binary ever does to itself, and the renderer —
//! shared, cloud-edition code that happens to be running in a desktop window —
//! has no business initiating it. Keeping it here has three further effects
//! that each matter on their own:
//!
//!   * the renderer's size ratchet never sees it (`bundle:check:desktop`);
//!   * the app's CSP does not have to admit an update host into `connect-src`,
//!     because the download is not made by the WebView;
//!   * `src/desktop/routes.ts` and the shared UI stay identical between the
//!     two editions, which is the whole premise of `docs/edition-gating.md`.
//!
//! # Why it asks
//!
//! An accounts application may not restart itself under someone's hands. The
//! check is silent, the offer is a native dialog, and declining is free — the
//! next launch asks again. This is the house rule about saying the consequence
//! before the remedy, applied to the one action whose consequence is "the
//! window you are working in will close".
//!
//! # What a failed check must never do
//!
//! Interrupt. GitHub being unreachable, a rate limit, an aeroplane — none of
//! them are the user's problem and none of them get a dialog. The error goes
//! to stderr and the program carries on exactly as it would have. The only
//! thing a broken update path may cost is the update.
//!
//! # The signature, and what is still owed
//!
//! Every artefact is signed with the release keypair; the public half lives in
//! `tauri.conf.json` and the private half only in the repository's Actions
//! secrets, so an endpoint that served a hostile payload would be refused by
//! the updater before a byte of it ran. That is separate from APPLE
//! notarisation: the `.dmg` on the release page is notarised by hand, but the
//! macOS update artefact is only ad-hoc signed, because CI has no Developer ID
//! certificate yet. Putting one in `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`
//! would sign both and retire the manual step — see that file's SIGNING note.
