//! Opening a ledger, making one, and working out whose it is.
//!
//! # `create_file` and `open_file` are COMMANDS, not verbs (PHASE3-PLAN D-5)
//!
//! Slice 18 left this open — the seam's header said the two were *"the desktop
//! shell's … slice 27"* without saying which surface they belong to — and there
//! are three reasons they are the shell's own commands rather than variants of
//! `wealth_core::command::Command`. Any one of them would be enough.
//!
//! **A path is not a payload.** `dispatch` deserialises a caller's JSON, and the
//! caller is a WebView. The entire argument for the ledger crate existing is
//! that the WebView is the part of this program most likely to be reached by an
//! extension, a malformed import, or a dependency with a supply-chain problem
//! (`lib.rs`: *"putting them in a WebView that … can reach"*). An
//! `{"verb":"open_file","payload":{"path":"…"}}` would hand that WebView the
//! ability to name any file on the disk — to open somebody's browser history or
//! their messaging database, both of which are SQLite, and to create a file
//! anywhere it can write. A path therefore never crosses the invoke boundary in
//! that direction: the renderer asks to open A ledger, the SHELL shows the
//! platform's own chooser, and the user's choice is the only path that exists.
//!
//! **There is no connection to dispatch over.** `dispatch(&mut Connection, …)`
//! takes an already-open ledger. A verb that OPENS one has nothing to be
//! dispatched against — it is what makes the argument the others need. The
//! crate already has a family in that shape, the `plan_*` admission commands,
//! and it answers them in `plan()` before a file is touched; a file verb is the
//! same observation from the other end.
//!
//! **It would be state in a crate that deliberately has none.** Which document
//! is open, and which locks are held, are properties of a running application.
//! `wealth-core` holds no globals and no session; keeping it that way is what
//! lets the differential harness run it as a process per call.
//!
//! R-10 is untouched by this. The rule is that the VERB SET has one exhaustive
//! match, and these are not verbs — there is no second dispatch, no `match` over
//! a string, and nothing here that a `Command` could ever also mean.
//!
//! # Whose rows are these? (PHASE3-PLAN D-5)
//!
//! `localDataPort.ts` states the rule and leaves the resolution here: *"the
//! owner of a local file is a uuid minted when the FILE is created, stored in
//! its one `users` row"*, and the port is CONSTRUCTED with it — never told one
//! per call.
//!
//! So [`create`] mints a v4 uuid and writes that row, and [`open`] reads it
//! back. What makes this more than one line is the cases where a file does not
//! have exactly one:
//!
//! * **no rows at all.** A real file: `wealth-core-cli --apply-schema` makes one
//!   (MEASURED — the harness's `LedgerFiles.create` produces exactly this), and
//!   so does any tool that applies the schema without adopting the result. It is
//!   a valid, empty, ownerless ledger and it is refused BY NAME, because the
//!   alternative is a window full of nothing that looks exactly like a new file.
//! * **more than one.** `schema.sql` says the table is *"kept for parity with
//!   the cloud … A local file holds exactly one row in practice; nothing here
//!   enforces that, because a future 'household' file may hold more"*. Until
//!   there is a screen that asks which person you are, picking one would be
//!   picking somebody's finances at random. Refused, with both ids named.
//!
//! Neither case can be produced by this shell. They are the two ways a file can
//! arrive from somewhere else, and a shell that only handled the files it wrote
//! itself would be a shell that opens other people's files wrongly.
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT written into a new file
//!
//! `schema_meta`. The schema creates it and documents the rows it is for
//! (`schema_version`, `created_at`, the four scales) and nothing in either
//! engine has ever written one — verified by grep across the crate and the
//! harness before this file was written. A version stamp that nothing compares
//! is a version stamp nobody can trust, and the moment it earns its write is the
//! moment something opens a file it did not create and has to decide whether it
//! can. That is the migration slice's decision to make, with the reader in front
//! of it; writing the row now would present a future reader with a value that
//! had never been checked against anything.
